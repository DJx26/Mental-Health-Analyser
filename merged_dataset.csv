"How would you react? Advice appreciated~ My life is worthless, everything is pointless and I need to go.

But I've seen a few posts here about people's friends that ended it...

I'm shit at emotions and I'm a selfish failure, I didn't really think about my friends a whole lot,

I don't understand why they would be sad, I don't get why it would effect them but reading said posts I now know it would

But I also don't want to live for others, I'm tired. So tired.

I would be gone already if I'd done it right, but now I wonder what they would think about it...

I didn't leave any letters, I wasn't planning to, but now I'm thinking that when I do try again I should leave them letters

What would be your concerns if one of your friends ended it? What things would you feel guilty or whatever about?

I want them to know it's not their fault in the slightest, but like I said I don't get emotions so some advice/ input from normal people would be nice

"I don't see the purpose of living anymore.I've always been incredibly socially inept, but until recently I've been (naively) trying to improve those skills, convinced that I can do something about my flaws. And I've managed that; I managed to gain a few friends that I hang out with time to time, and I've managed to become able to talk to people without losing my nerve. Compared to many others here, I'm not even sure if I have a right to be talking like this; I feel like I should feel happy, that my situation is so much more fortunate than others.

I'm a person that spends his time musing about philosophy. When I am with my friends or with family, I feel a boost of initial happiness; for that time, I can forget about things, and just enjoy life. But afterwards, I notice that my thought patterns have been incredibly ""dumbed down"" compared to when I'm alone, and that this boost of happiness is only a sort of narcotic, distracting me from the truth.

And I've started to see the truth in a different light. At school, I can start paving the way to a ""successful life""; get good grades, enter a good college, get a good job; but in the end, none of that matters. I'm also become convinced that what we call ""love"" is only the mindset originating from loneliness combined with biological sexual attraction; and that it really doesn't exist. Humans can only think, fundamentally, for and about themselves.

So what's the point? The truth about life is that everything is meaningless; if I do something amazing, that might temporarily distract me, but happiness isn't the baseline. It always returns to the meaninglessness of life. Even worse, I feel that during these thoughts my mind feels the most clear; and I've become convinced that ""happiness"" itself is an illusion.

I don't think I will kill myself; no, I'm much too much a coward for that, and I can't bring that pain to my family as well. No, I feel like I'll keep slogging on, every day, doing superficial things, while continually tormented by the thought that none of this matters. I feel like I'm running every day on no energy, and I have no idea what to do.

Again, do I even have a right to talk like this? I see people in so much worse situations; I'm an educated intellectual, or at least I'm supposed to be. I'm sincerely sorry for rambling so much, but I really couldn't think of anything else.",,Depressed
"My depression is back. A few weeks ago I was on top of the world, talking with good friends, online and school friends feeling like I had everything. I didn’t have to worry about a thing. 

A week ago everything changed. A good online friend of mine died. I haven’t been sleeping well, everything I’ve ever enjoyed seems tedious and I’m beginning to loose motivation to even get out of bed in the morning. Even things I wasn’t fond of but tolerated such as school have become even more depressing pits. I’ve been failing all of the tests I’ve had over the past week and am starting to see life as a pointless series of events. 
School is currently stressing me out so much I haven’t even been able to even wrap my head around what happened to my friend. I keep telling myself he’s alive and every notification is him saying he’s ok. I’m starting to see school as something to lead up to a job I have to work at so I can die with some money and dignity. 
I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to keep going in this cycle. I’ve been on anti depressants for a while (over a year) and enjoying the lack of pain. Over the past week it’s all come crashing back down.

It's not the only reason I want to kill myself but I think my social anxiety is the root of my depression. I want to go to a therapist but I'm too scarred to take a fucking appointment, I so mad at myself for being like that. 

My family told me that there gonna take an appointment to a therapist for me but they still haven't done it, I don't blame them, I should do it myself but I Just can't cause I'm too much of a baby to make a fucking phone call.

And my family know I play guitar, if I played then they'd hate it, I'm honestly going to struggle when my dad's parents come to his. They're going to expect me to play, and they'll expect classical music or something, I'll probably give them a heart attack if I play anything I like.

This is fucking ridiculous the way that where I live they're letting people meet up and break quarantine for one fucking day, and I'm going to have to try and remember all of my extended family's names. Then I'll have to talk to them as if I'm a mentally stable human being who doesn't just want to leave.

What else?

"When do things get better?Throughout high school I had a only 2-3 friends and was never really liked by anyone. I knew that people said bad things about me, I just blocked it out. I had a girlfriend my first year of high school that I told everything to and after we broke up she told people my deepest darkest secrets. I enlisted in the Army Reserves to try and maybe make my life better but I’ve been in for almost 5 years and it only makes me hate my life more. I’ve been out of high school for about 3 years and I’ve dropped out of college and had to move back home because I can’t afford to live alone. I feel like a failure in the eyes of my family and friends. I stopped going to church lately and don’t feel motivated to go again even though it feels like it’ll make things better. I’ve been dating a girl for 2 years and I’ve loved it but in the past few months it feels like she’s just trying to get rid of me. I’ve applied for promotions at work that would finally let me move out and make things better but I’ve been turned down for all of them. It just feels like nothing good happens in life and I often think about ending my life just so I don’t have to feel like a disappointment anymore. It feels like ever since middle school I haven’t had any successes. I don’t want to live a life full of rejection and disappointment. I’m afraid to kill myself because a small part of me thinks that if I do die I might make those around me upset by my death but a larger part of me thinks that it would be a relief.

"About “it will get better”.This is my view, from someone suicidal.

A lot of the time, probably most of the time for most people on here, it won’t just “get better”. Even though we didn’t cause of our problems (a lot of us), they’re ours to own now. And if we want our problems to be fixed, WE have to do it OURSELVES. We own the problems now. And it will probably be very, very hard to fix them. And it will hurt a lot more than I can put into words for a lot of us. 

But in the end, if we can do the work that needs to be done and go through the pain, we can fix/remedy our problems. We can make it out on the other side. A better side. 

And it can be more than worth the pain we have to go through to fix it. It will hurt, but sometimes that pain is more than worth it.

I wanted to address this. We all hear people say it “will get better”, as if we can just sit around and do nothing and it will get better by itself. That’s not true for almost everyone.

For almost all of us, WE have to make it better. Or, if we just leave it alone, it will just get worse for many of us.

She left me about a fortnight ago, and i've taken it fairly well up until now. She kept saying she still wants to be my friend, and that she still cares about me, that I still have a place in her heart, but actions speak louder than words and she ignores me when I need to talk to her the most, holds the smallest of things against me, and is generally making me feel worthless/like she wants me dead.

what makes it worse is that I've always tried to give her the best of everything, and being with her was the only thing I looked forward to at the end of the day. I no longer speak to my family for personal reasons and have no friends where I currently live, and i'm not able to move anywhere else due to a lack of funds. I literally tried to give her the world, before I lost my job I was saving up and was going to surprise her for her birthday in 2 years, letting her choose where on earth she wanted to go, and for how long.

Now I just feel like I'm falling with nothing to grab on to, I can't take pleasure from even the smallest of things like playing a video game over the net with a few guys I know (once again, met over the net) because my thoughts always go back to her and her beautiful smile.

I can't see any reason to go on when the only reason I truly care about doesn't care about me anymore, please, just give me something to look forward to, something to change my mind before I do something stupid, because it seems like it's the only way I won't feel like I've been poisoned from the inside at the moment.

"How should I make the first move to kiss my girlfriend. Dating for a month and a half I know this might sound like a typical highschool relationship ,but this is my first serious relationship and I want to do this right. I[17M] have been dating her [16F] for about a month and a half ,but we have been talking for over 5 months and just recently I confessed I liked her but we have discussed what we want in a relationship and we are both dating to marry and not just dating to date. I talked to her dad because she wanted that but I told her I wanted to aswell. Her dad [55M] said this is her first relationship and that he wants a healthy relationship and he said that I can put my arm around her and kiss her on the cheek and hold hands when I feel it’s right too. He asked though to come back to him when I want to kiss her on the mouth and he explained how that level of affection is a lot for a woman and she will get attached to it. Both our families live in a Christian home. I don’t know when the right time to kiss her is. I kissed her on the cheek one time when we hugged but I felt like she either didn’t realize it or she ignored it because she didn’t kiss back. I feel like i’m overthinking this relationship. I have kissed multiple girls in the past but this girl I don’t want to mess it up. I see a bright future with each other. I’m pretty sure she hasn’t been in a relationship before but she has talked alittle about the people she used to talk to in the past. We both hang out atleast once a week to grab some food or something small. We also don’t have too many places to go to kiss like outside wise because it’s getting a lot colder and I just don’t want to mess up our relationship.

So basically I decided to make a wish list like normal people do, and started thinking about videogames, movies, Lego, etc.




 I was going to write something to the first spot when the realization kicked in. ""Do I actually want this, or is it just an illusion created by my mind?"" I started thinking what I really wanted and needed and wouldn't regret wishing for. I tried to write something again but the same thought got me again. ""Someday you are going to think that you should've wished for something else"".


 Now I was starting to panic. Do I really want anything and does it even matter? Then the dream of having someone to love and love me back came to mind, and I realized, that was the only thing that I would never regret wanting. Of course the only thing that comes to my mind is something that you can't get as a present.


 At this point already half an hour had passed and I had written nothing on the paper. I had thought of everything. Feeling unaccomplished in every way, I faceplanted on my bed and stayed like that for the next thirty minutes thinking about what it is to want, to need, to love, to exist.

I certainly find nothing particularly inviting or encouraging about life in general.  I've worked so hard to have accomplished none of my real goals in life.  I've seen so many opportunities go to others while I'm left at the kids table, hopelessly earning what little scraps I can scavenge.  There's honestly nothing to look forward to, nothing to really have any optimism to feel in working towards anything.

I also have realized lately I have no real autonomy in my life.  I have bills to pay, I have to work, I have to do so many things that others tell me.  My life is not my own, I'm merely subservient to the wills and demands of others.  As soon as I begin to even stray from the script that others have written for me, I'm beaten back down until I obey again.  

All life is is obeying until you die.  Any sense autonomy or free will is just a sordid illusion.  My only destiny is to obey and die in that order.  I can't believe the audacity of the people I work with and the other people that live their lives thinking that anything they will do will ever matter.  Today at work I have a number of things to do that will be utterly useless and totally forgotten in just a few months time.  Yet I have to pretend that it's the most important thing in the universe because the person that enslaves me with a paycheck laughably thinks so.  The people who fool themselves with delusions of relevancy darkly amuse me.

This isn't a life worth living.  All of my existence is fake.  It's just putting on a mask which makes others believe I'm happy, when the reality is each day is torture.  I don't think I have any real ""friends,"" because those who know me enjoy the time of a character I'm playing.  It's not honest.  If they got to know the real me, they'd hate me.  I'm so paranoid that I might let my real personality or thoughts get out to them, and then they'd betray me.  It's probably inevitable.  Any given moment, I'm likely to slip.  They'll see through me and realize that instead of an obedient single-serving and irrelevant human being, I'm consumed with darkness and obsessed with death.  Then I'll have nothing, not even the fake relationships that barely let me hang on to sanity.

"Whole fucking cosmos episode 1 (1980) script Hello. My name is Ann Druyan. When Carl Sagan, Steven Soter and I wrote the Cosmos TV series in the late 1970s, a lot of things were different. Back then, the United States and the Soviet Union held the whole planet in a perpetual hostage crisis called the Cold War. The wealth and scientific ingenuity of our civilization was being squandered on a runaway arms race that employed half the world’s scientists and infested the world with 50,000 nuclear weapons.
So much has happened since then. The Cold War is history and science has made great strides. We’ve completed the spacecraft reconnaissance of the solar system, the preliminary mapping of the visible universe that surrounds us, and we’ve charted the universe within: the human genome.
When Cosmos was first broadcast, there was no world wide web. It was a different world. What a tribute to Carl Sagan: a scientist who took many a punch for daring to speculate that, even after 20 of the most eventful years in the history of science, Cosmos requires few revisions and, indeed, is rich in prophecy.
Cosmos is both a history of the scientific enterprise and an attempt to convey the soaring spiritual high of its central revelation: our oneness with the universe. Now, please, enjoy Cosmos—the proud saga of how, through the searching of 40,000 generations of our ancestors, we have come to discover our coordinates in space and in time. And how, through the awesomely powerful method of science, we have been able to reconstruct the sweep of cosmic evolution and defined our own part in its great story.

THE SHORES OF THE COSMIC OCEAN

The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our contemplations of the cosmos stir us. There is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation: as if a distant memory of falling from a great height. We know we are approaching the grandest of mysteries.
The size and age of the cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home, the Earth. For the first time, we have the power to decide the fate of our planet and ourselves. This is a time of great danger, but our species is young and curious and brave. It shows much promise. In the last few millennia we’ve made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the cosmos and our place within it. I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.
We’re about to begin a journey through the cosmos. We’ll encounter galaxies, and suns, and planets, life and consciousness coming into being, evolving and perishing. Worlds of ice and stars of diamond. Atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms. But it’s also a story of our own planet, and the plants and animals that share it with us. And it’s a story about us: how we achieved our present understanding of the cosmos, how the cosmos has shaped our evolution and our culture, and what our fate may be.
We wish to pursue the truth, no matter where it leads. But to find the truth, we need imagination and skepticism both. We will not be afraid to speculate. But we will be careful to distinguish speculation from fact. The cosmos is full beyond measure of elegant truths of exquisite interrelationships of the awesome machinery of nature.
The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore we have learned most of what we know. Recently, we’ve waded a little way out—maybe ankle-deep—and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can. Because the cosmos is also within us. We’re made of star-stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.
The journey for each of us begins here. We’re going to explore the cosmos in a ship of the imagination unfettered by ordinary limits on speed and size, drawn by the music of cosmic harmonies. It can take us anywhere in space and time. Perfect as a snowflake, organic as a dandelion seed, it will carry us to worlds of dreams and worlds of facts. Come with me.

GALAXIES

Before us is the cosmos on the grandest scale we know. We are far from the shores of Earth in the uncharted reaches of the cosmic ocean. Strewn like sea froth on the waves of space are innumerable faint tendrils of light, some of them containing hundreds of billions of suns. These are the galaxies drifting endlessly in the great cosmic dark. In our ship of the imagination we are halfway to the edge of the known universe. In this, the first of our cosmic voyages, we begin to explore the universe revealed by science. Our course will eventually carry us to a far-off and exotic world. But from the depths of space, we cannot detect even the cluster of galaxies in which our Milky Way is embedded, much less the sun or the Earth.
We are in the realm of the galaxies, 8 billion light years from home. No matter where we travel, the patterns of nature are the same as in the form of this spiral galaxy. The same laws of physics apply everywhere throughout the cosmos. But we have just begun to understand these laws. The universe is rich in mystery. Near the center of a cluster of galaxies, there’s sometimes a rogue, elliptical galaxy made of a trillion suns which devours its neighbors. Perhaps this cyclone of stars is what astronomers on Earth call a quasar.
Our ordinary measures of distance fail us here in the realm of the galaxies. We need a much larger unit: the light year. It measures how far light travels in a year: nearly 10 trillion kilometers. It measures not time, but enormous distances.
In the Hercules cluster, the individual galaxies are about 300,000 light years apart, so light takes about 300,000 years to go from one galaxy to another. Like stars and planets and people, galaxies are born, live, and die. They may all experience a tumultuous adolescence. During their first 100 million years, their cores may explode. Seen in radio light, great jets of energy pour out and echo across the cosmos. Worlds near the core or along the jets would be incinerated. I wonder how many planets and how many civilizations might be destroyed.
In the Pegasus cluster, there’s a ring galaxy the wreckage left from the collision of two galaxies. A splash in the cosmic pond. Individual galaxies may explode and collide, and their constituent stars may blow up as well. In this supernova explosion a single star outshines the rest of its galaxy.
We are approaching what astronomers on Earth call the Local Group. Three million light years across, it contains some 20 galaxies. It’s a sparse and rather typical chain of islands in the immense cosmic ocean. We are now only 2 million light years from home. On the maps of space, this galaxy is called M31: the great galaxy in Andromeda. It’s a vast storm of stars and gas and dust. As we pass over it, we see one of its small satellite galaxies.
Clusters of galaxies and the stars of individual galaxies are all held together by gravity. Surrounding M31 are hundreds of globular star clusters. We’re approaching one of them. Each cluster orbits the massive center of the galaxy. Some contain up to a million separate stars. Every globular cluster is like a swarm of bees bound by gravity; every bee a sun. From Pegasus, our voyage has taken us 200 million light years to the Local Group dominated by two great spiral galaxies.
Beyond M31 is another very similar galaxy. Its spiral arms slowly turning once every quarter billion years. This is our own Milky Way seen from the outside. This is the home galaxy of the human species. In the obscure backwaters of the Carina-Cygnus spiral arm, we humans have evolved to consciousness and some measure of understanding. Concentrated in its brilliant core and strewn along its spiral arms are 400 billion suns. It takes light 100,000 years to travel from one end of the galaxy to the other. Within this galaxy are stars, worlds, and—it may be—an enormous diversity of living things and intelligent beings and space-faring civilizations.

STARS

Scattered among the stars of the Milky Way are supernova remnants, each one the remains of a colossal stellar explosion. These filaments of glowing gas are the outer layers of a star which has recently destroyed itself. The gas is unraveling returning star-stuff back into space. And at its heart are the remains of the original star: a dense, shrunken stellar fragment called a pulsar. A natural lighthouse, blinking and hissing. A sun that spins twice each second. Pulsars keep such perfect time that the first one discovered was thought to be a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence. Perhaps a navigational beacon for great ships that travel across the light years and between the stars. There may be such intelligences and such starships, but pulsars are not their signature. Instead, they are the doleful reminders that nothing lasts forever; that stars also die.
We continue to plummet, falling thousands of light years towards the plane of the galaxy. This is the Milky Way, our galaxy, seen edge-on: billions of nuclear furnaces converting matter into starlight. Some stars are flimsy as a soap bubble. Others are a hundred trillion times denser than lead. The hottest stars are destined to die young. But red giants are mostly elderly. Such stars are unlikely to have inhabited planets. But yellow dwarf stars, like the sun, are middle-aged and they are far more common. These stars may have planetary systems. And on such planets, for the first time on our cosmic voyage, we encounter rare forms of matter: ice and rock, air and liquid water.
Close to this yellow star is a small, warm, cloudy world with continents and oceans. These conditions permit an even more precious form of matter to arise: life. But this is not the Earth. Intelligent beings have evolved and reworked this planetary surface in a massive engineering enterprise. In the Milky Way galaxy, there may be many worlds on which matter has grown to consciousness. I wonder, are they very different from us? What do they look like? What are their politics, technology, music, religion? Or do they have patterns of culture we can’t begin to imagine? Are they also a danger to themselves?
Among the many glowing clouds of interstellar gas is one called the Orion Nebula, only 1,500 light years from Earth. These three bright stars are seen by earthlings as the belt in the familiar constellation of Orion the hunter. The nebula appears from Earth as a patch of light: the middle star in Orion’s sword. But it is not a star. It is another thing entirely: a cloud that veils one of nature’s secret places. This is a stellar nursery, a place where stars are born. They condense by gravity from gas and dust until their temperatures become so high that they begin to shine. Such clouds mark the births of stars as others bear witness to their deaths.
And after stars condense in the hidden interiors of interstellar clouds, what happens to them? The Pleiades are a loose cluster of young stars only 50 million years old. These fledgling stars are just being let out into the galaxy. Still surrounded by wisps of nebulosity, the gas and dust from which they formed.
There are clouds that hang like inkblots between the stars. They are made of fine rocky dust, organic matter, and ice. Inside, a few stars begin to turn on. Nearby worlds of ice evaporate and form long, comet-like tails driven back by the stellar winds. Black clouds, light years across, drift between the stars. They’re filled with organic molecules. The building blocks of life are everywhere. They’re easily made. On how many worlds have such complex molecules assembled themselves into patterns we would call alive?

THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Most stars belong to systems of two or three or many suns bound together by gravity. Each system is isolated from its neighbors by the light years. We are approaching a single, ordinary, yellow dwarf star surrounded by a system of nine planets, dozens of moons, thousands of asteroids, and billions of comets: the family of the sun. Only four light hours from Earth is the planet Neptune and its giant satellite, Triton. Even in the outskirts of our own solar system, we humans have barely begun our explorations. Only a century ago, we were ignorant even of the existence of the planet Pluto. Its moon, Charon, remained undiscovered until 1978. The rings of Uranus were first detected in 1977. There are new worlds to chart even this close to home. Saturn is a giant gas world. If it has a solid surface, it must lie far below the clouds we see. Saturn’s majestic rings are made of trillions of orbiting snowballs. We are now only 80 light minutes from home. A mere one and a half billion kilometers. The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter. On its dark side, super bolts of lightning illuminate the clouds as first revealed by the Voyager spacecraft in 1979.
Inside the orbit of Jupiter are countless shattered and broken worldlets: the asteroids. These reefs and shoals mark the border of the realm of giant planets. We are now entering the shallows of the solar system. Here there are worlds with thin atmospheres and solid surfaces: Earth-like planets with landscapes crying out for careful exploration. This world is Mars. In 1976, after a year’s voyage, two robot explorers from Earth landed on this alien shore. On Mars, there is a volcano as wide as Arizona and almost three times the height of Mount Everest. We’ve named it Mount Olympus. This is a world of wonders. Mars is a planet with ancient river valleys and violent sandstorms driven by winds at half the speed of sound. There is a giant rift in its surface 5,000 kilometers long. It’s called Vallis Marineris: the valley of the Mariner spacecraft that came to explore Mars from a nearby world.
In this, our first cosmic voyage, we have just begun the reconnaissance of Mars and all those other planets and stars and galaxies. In voyages to come, we will explore them more fully. But now, we travel the few remaining light minutes to a blue and cloudy world, third from the sun. The end of our long journey is the world where we began. Our travels allow us to see the Earth anew as if we came from somewhere else. There are a hundred billion galaxies and a billion trillion stars. Why should this modest planet be the only inhabited world? To me, it seems far more likely that the cosmos is brimming over with life and intelligence. But so far, every living thing, every conscious being, every civilization we know anything about lived there, on Earth. Beneath these clouds the drama of the human species has been unfolded. We have, at last, come home.

EARTH

Welcome to the planet Earth. A place with blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water, cool forests, soft meadows. A world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic perspective it is, for the moment, unique. The only world in which we know with certainty that the matter of the cosmos has become alive and aware. There must be many such worlds scattered through space, but our search for them begins here with the accumulated wisdom of the men and women of our species acquired at great cost over a million years.
There was once a time when our little planet seemed immense. When it was the only world we could explore. Its true size was first worked out in a simple and ingenious way by a man who lived here, in Egypt, in the third century B.C. This tower may have been a communications tower, part of a network running along the North African coast, by which signal bonfires were used to communicate messages of state. It also may have been used as a lighthouse; a navigational beacon for sailing ships out there in the Mediterranean Sea. It is about 50 kilometers west of what was once one of the great cities of the world, Alexandria.

CURIOSITY LEADS TO SCIENCE

In Alexandria, at that time, there lived a man named Eratosthenes. One of his envious contemporaries called him “beta”—the second letter of the Greek alphabet—because, he said, “Eratosthenes was second-best in the world in everything.” But it seems clear that, in many fields, Eratosthenes was “alpha.” He was an astronomer, historian, geographer, philosopher, poet, theater critic, and mathematician. He was also the chief librarian of the Great Library of Alexandria. And one day, while reading a papyrus book in the library, he came upon a curious account.
Far to the south—he read—at the frontier outpost of Syene, something notable could be seen on the longest day of the year. On June 21st, the shadows of a temple column, or a vertical stick, would grow shorter as noon approached. And as the hours crept towards midday, the sun’s rays would slither down the sides of a deep well which on other days would remain in shadow. And then, precisely at noon, columns would cast no shadows and the sun would shine directly down into the water of the well. At that moment the sun was exactly overhead.
It was an observation that someone else might easily have ignored. Sticks, shadows, reflections in wells, the position of the sun: simple, everyday matters—of what possible importance might they be? But Eratosthenes was a scientist and his contemplation of these homely matters changed the world; in a way, made the world. Because Eratosthenes had the presence of mind to experiment: to actually ask whether, back here, near Alexandria, a stick cast a shadow near noon on June the 21st. And it turns out, sticks do.
An overly skeptical person might have said that the report from Syene was an error. But it’s an absolutely straightforward observation. Why would anyone lie on such a trivial matter? Eratosthenes asked himself how it could be that at the same moment a stick in Syene would cast no shadow and a stick in Alexandria, 800 kilometers to the north, would cast a very definite shadow.
Here is a map of ancient Egypt. I’ve inserted two sticks, or obelisks. One up here in Alexandria and one down here in Syene. Now, if at a certain moment each stick casts no shadow—no shadow at all—that’s perfectly easy to understand, provided the Earth is flat. If the shadow at Syene is at a certain length and the shadow at Alexandria is the same length, that also makes sense on a flat Earth. But how could it be, Eratosthenes asked, that at the same instant there was no shadow at Syene and a very substantial shadow at Alexandria? The only answer was that the surface of the Earth is curved. Not only that, but the greater the curvature, the bigger the difference in the lengths of the shadows. The sun is so far away that its rays are parallel when they reach the Earth. Sticks at different angles to the sun’s rays will cast shadows at different lengths.
For the observed difference in the shadow lengths, the distance between Alexandria and Syene had to be about seven degrees along the surface of the Earth. By that I mean: if you would imagine these sticks extending all the way down to the center of the Earth, they would there intersect at an angle of about seven degrees. Well, seven degrees is something like a 50th of the full circumference of the Earth; 360 degrees. Eratosthenes knew the distance between Alexandria and Syene. He knew it was 800 kilometers. Why? Because he hired a man to pace out the entire distance so that he could perform the calculation I’m talking about. Now, 800 kilometers times 50 is 40,000 kilometers. So that must be the circumference of the Earth. That’s how far it is to go once around the Earth.
That’s the right answer. Eratosthenes’ only tools were sticks, eyes, feet and brains—plus a zest for experiment. With those tools, he correctly deduced the circumference of the Earth to high precision with an error of only a few percent. That’s pretty good figuring for 2,200 years ago.
Then, as now, the Mediterranean was teeming with ships. Merchantmen, fishing vessels, naval flotillas. But there were also courageous voyages into the unknown. 400 years before Eratosthenes, Africa was circumnavigated by a Phoenician fleet in the employ of the Egyptian pharaoh Necho. They set sail—probably in boats as frail and open as these—out from the Red Sea, down the east coast of Africa, up into the Atlantic, and then back through the Mediterranean. That epic journey took three years—about as long as it takes Voyager to journey from Earth to Saturn.
After Eratosthenes, some may have attempted to circumnavigate the Earth. But until the time of Magellan, no one succeeded. What tales of adventure and daring must earlier have been told as sailors and navigators, practical men of the world, gambled their lives on the mathematics of a scientist from ancient Alexandria?
Today, Alexandria shows few traces of its ancient glory of the days when Eratosthenes walked its broad avenues. Over the centuries, waves of conquerors converted its palaces and temples into castles and churches, then into minarets and mosques. The city was chosen to be the capital of his empire by Alexander the Great on a winter’s afternoon in 331 B.C. A century later, it had become the greatest city of the world. Each successive civilization has left its mark.
But what now remains of the marvel city of Alexander’s dream? Alexandria is still a thriving marketplace, still a crossroads for the peoples of the Near East. But once, it was radiant with self-confidence; certain of its power. Can you recapture a vanished epoch from a few broken statues and scraps of ancient manuscripts?
In Alexandria, there was an immense library and an associated research institute. And in them worked the finest minds in the ancient world. Of that legendary library, all that survives is this dank and forgotten cellar. It’s in the library annex, the Serapeum, which was once a temple but was later reconsecrated to knowledge. These few moldering shelves, probably once in a basement storage room, are its only physical remains. But this place was once the brain and glory of the greatest city on the planet Earth.
If I could travel back into time, this is the place I would visit. The Library of Alexandria at its height, 2,000 years ago. Here, in an important sense, began the intellectual adventure which has led us into space. All the knowledge in the ancient world was once within these marble walls. In the great hall, there may have been a mural of Alexander with the crook and flail and ceremonial headdress of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. This library was a citadel of human consciousness; a beacon on our journey to the stars.
It was the first true research institute in the history of the world. And what did they study? They studied everything. The entire cosmos. “Cosmos” is a Greek word for the order of the universe. In a way, it’s the opposite of chaos. It implies a deep interconnectedness of all things. The intricate and subtle way that the universe is put together. Genius flourished here. In addition to Eratosthenes, there was the astronomer Hipparchus who mapped the constellations and established the brightness of the stars. And there was Euclid who brilliantly systematized geometry, who told his king—who was struggling with some difficult problem in mathematics—that there was no royal road to geometry. There was Dionysius of Thrace, the man who defined the parts of speech—nouns, verbs, and so on—who did for language, in a way, what Euclid did for geometry. There was Herophilos, a physiologist who identified the brain, rather than the heart, as the seat of intelligence. There was Archimedes, the greatest mechanical genius until the time of Leonardo da Vinci. And there was the astronomer Ptolemy, who compiled much of what today is the pseudoscience of astrology. His Earth-centered universe held sway for 1,500 years, showing that intellectual brilliance is no guarantee against being dead wrong. And among these great men there was also a great woman. Her name was Hypatia. She was a mathematician and an astronomer, the last light of the library whose martyrdom is bound up with the destruction of this place seven centuries after it was founded.
Look at this place! The Greek kings of Egypt who succeeded Alexander regarded advances in science, literature and medicine as among the treasures of the empire. For centuries, they generously supported research and scholarship. An enlightenment shared by few heads of state, then or now. Off this great hall were ten large research laboratories. There were fountains and colonnades, botanical gardens, and even a zoo with animals from India and sub-Saharan Africa. There were dissecting rooms and an astronomical observatory.
But the treasure of the library—consecrated to the god Serapis, built in the city of Alexander—was its collection of books. The organizers of the library combed all the cultures and languages of the world for books. They sent agents abroad to buy up libraries. Commercial ships docking in Alexandria harbor were searched by the police—not for contraband, but for books. The scrolls were borrowed, copied, and returned to their owners. Until studied, these scrolls were collected in great stacks called “books from the ships.” Accurate numbers are difficult to come by, but it seems that the library contained at its peak nearly one million scrolls.
The papyrus reed grows in Egypt. It’s the origin of our word for “paper.” And each of those million volumes which once existed in this library were handwritten on papyrus manuscript scrolls. What happened to all those books? Well, the classical civilization that created them disintegrated. The library itself was destroyed. Only a small fraction of the works survived. And as for the rest, we’re left only with pathetic scattered fragments. But how tantalizing those remaining bits and pieces are!
For example, we know that there once existed here a book by the astronomer Aristarchus of Samos, who apparently argued that the Earth was one of the planets that, like the other planets, it orbits the sun, and that the stars are enormously far away. All absolutely correct. But we had to wait nearly 2,000 years for these facts to be rediscovered.
The astronomy stacks of the Alexandria Library. Hipparchus. Ptolomeus. Here we are. Aristarchus. This is the book. How I’d love to be able to read this book! To know how Aristarchus figured it out. But it’s gone. Utterly and forever. If we multiply our sense of loss for this work of Aristarchus by 100,000, we begin to appreciate the grandeur of the achievement of classical civilization, and the tragedy of its destruction.
We have far surpassed the science known to the ancient world, but there are irreparable gaps in our historical knowledge. Imagine what mysteries of the past could be solved with a borrower’s card to this library. For example, we know of a three-volume history of the world now lost, written by a Babylonian priest named Berossus. Volume I dealt with the interval from the creation of the world to the Great Flood. A period that he took to be 432,000 years, or about a hundred times longer than the Old Testament chronology. What wonders were in the books of Berossus!
But why have I brought you across 2,000 years to the Library of Alexandria? Because this was when and where we humans first collected seriously and systematically the knowledge of the world. This is the Earth as Eratosthenes knew it. A tiny, spherical world, afloat in an immensity of space and time. We were, at long last, beginning to find our true bearings in the cosmos. The scientists of antiquity took the first and most important steps in that direction before their civilization fell apart. But after the Dark Ages, it was by and large the rediscovery of the works of these scholars done here that made the Renaissance possible, and thereby powerfully influenced our own culture. When, in the 15th century, Europe was at last ready to awaken from its long sleep, it picked up some of the tools, the books, and the concepts laid down here more than a thousand years before.

LOOKING UP AND OUT

By 1600, the long-forgotten ideas of Aristarchus had been rediscovered. Johannes Kepler constructed elaborate models to understand the motion and arrangement of the planets; the clockwork of the heavens. And at night, he dreamt of traveling to the moon. His principal scientific tools were the mathematics of the Alexandrian Library and an unswerving respect for the facts—however disquieting they might be. His story, and the story of the scientists who came after him, are also part of our voyage.
Seventy years later, the sun-centered universe of Aristarchus and Copernicus was widely accepted in the Europe of the Enlightenment. The idea arose that the planets were worlds governed by laws of nature, and scientific speculation turned to the motions of the stars. The clockwork in the heavens was imitated by the watchmakers of Earth. Precise timekeeping permitted great sailing ship voyages of exploration and discovery which bound up the Earth. This was a time when free inquiry was valued once again.
250 years later, the Earth was all explored. New adventurers now looked to the planets and the stars. The galaxies were recognized as great aggregates of stars; island universes millions of light years away. In the 1920s, astronomers had begun to measure the speeds of distant galaxies. They found that the galaxies were flying away from one another. To the astonishment of everyone, the entire universe was expanding. We had begun to plumb the true depths of time and space. The long, collective enterprise of science has revealed a universe some 15 billion years old. The time since the explosive birth of the cosmos the Big Bang.

THE COSMIC CALENDAR

The cosmic calendar compresses the local history of the universe into a single year. If the universe began on January 1st, it was not until May that the Milky Way formed. Other planetary systems may have appeared in June, July, and August, but our sun and Earth not until mid-September. Life arose soon after. Everything humans have ever done occurred in that bright speck at the lower right of the cosmic calendar. The Big Bang is at upper left in the first second of January 1st. Fifteen billion years later is our present time: the last second of December 31st.
Every month is 1¼ billion years long. Each day represents 40 million years. Each second stands for some 500 years of our history. The blinking of an eye in the drama of cosmic time. At this scale, the cosmic calendar is the size of a football field, but all of human history would occupy an area the size of my hand. We’re just beginning to trace the long and tortuous path which began with the primeval fireball and led to the condensation of matter: gas, dust, stars, galaxies, and—at least in our little nook of the universe—planets and life, intelligence and inquisitive men and women. We’ve emerged so recently that the familiar events of our recorded history occupy only the last seconds of the last minute of December 31st. Some critical events for the human species, however, began much earlier: minutes earlier.
So we change our scale from months to minutes. Down here, the first humans made their debut around 10:30 p.m. on December 31st. And with the passing of every cosmic minute—each minute 30,000 years long—we began the arduous journey towards understanding where we live and who we are.
11:46—only 14 minutes ago, humans have tamed fire. 11:59:20—the evening of the last day of the cosmic year, the 11st hour, the 59st minute, the 20st second, the domestication of plants and animals begins. An application of the human talent for making tools. 11:59:35—settled agricultural communities evolved into the first cities.
We humans appear on the comic calendar so recently that our recorded history occupies only the last few seconds of the last minute of December 31st. In the vast ocean of time which this calendar represents, all our memories are confined to this small square. Every person we’ve ever heard of lived somewhere in there. All those kings and battles, migrations and inventions, wars and loves. Everything in the history books happens here, in the last 10 seconds of the cosmic calendar.
We on Earth have just awakened to the great oceans of space and time from which we have emerged. We are the legacy of 15 billion years of cosmic evolution. We have a choice: we can enhance life and come to know the universe that made us, or we can squander our 15-billion-year heritage in meaningless self-destruction. What happens in the first second of the next cosmic year depends on what we do, here and now, with our intelligence and our knowledge of the cosmos.",,Anxious

I'm extremely introverted, so I find it hard to make friends, and just get on with people in general. I have depression issues and I think lowest of myself almost all the time.
Sometimes I find it pathetic that I feel this way; there's hardship going on all over the world and I'm complaining over stupid emotions, and this just makes me feel weak.
Something that's been a huge factor in my depression is that I want to be a female. I haven't ever told anyone this but I feel like I'm in the wrong body sometimes.

"Great. Awesome. I still want to die.I hit my goal weight. Below it, actually. I've officially lost 50.2 pounds since January and I'm really proud of myself. I promised my boyfriend that I'd at least make some sort of attempt to recover since I got to this point, because I'm actually underweight now with a BMI of 18.1, and I've increased my intake to 900 calories a day. 

Now he's ignoring me. Like I'm not worth paying attention to if I don't need to be persuaded to eat. It's horrible and shitty and manipulative of me to be thinking this way but now that I'm trying to get better I haven't heard a peep out of him. When I was starving myself he was constantly checking up on me. 

Even at this weight, I still feel fat. I'm 25 pounds away from my ultimate goal weight. I kind of just want to keep losing and see what happens, but I also just want to die and give up and be done. I'm tired. 

Maybe I should keep losing. Maybe I should keep going until there's no more fat to lose and my body starts eating its own muscles to survive and I die in my sleep of heart failure. The good ol' anorexic death. I know I'd love getting to that point and it would be painless, the hard part is just staying alive long enough to die of natural causes instead of shooting myself in the fucking face or jumping off the nearest bridge.

"It's only logical...  I find myself in a situation that the only way to avoid eventually busting out is to simply fold in my hand, and quit. I get told that I have it better than others. However, I find that I'd rather trade in the next 2 years of my contract to live as a termo cancer patient with less than 6 months of life. If they were to give me the choice right now between a bullet in the head or working here for the next 20 years I'd bite the bullet.

  I wake up every morning finding myself running through the motions of life day in and day out, which isn't even that hard when every activity for me is preplanned. Being thousand of miles away from family, and friends means that for all purposes they might as well not even exist, so It's not like I have anything to do anyways, not that I do much, but read, and do mindless labor as an ""indentured servant"". This ""organization"" has caused me to lose much of my emotions, passions, or anything that one would even consider human like I've even lost my entire sex drive - I might masterbate once a month if I'm feeling super about life, but those months never come by anymore. I would love, and cry with happiness to leave this organization, but doing so they would destroy any possible life if the ""organization"" were to prematurely terminate the contract, but staying in is just so unbearable that every minute that I'm at work I got this feeling of throwing up, dizzy, and so much hate that I can't even think right, and these bastards work me over 96 hours a week of hard manual labor for a lousy piece of shit paycheck that a fucking burger flipper at mcdonalds working 40 hours a week would make me look like a beggar.

  I've been almost clinically depressed(haven't seen any professionals, but it's pretty obvious, and I've read a lot, and taken test which I usually get every answer for depression checked) like this for about a year and a half, and it hasn't gotten any better, and seems to be getting worse lately, such as yesterday I found myself being veiled by a cloak, and the only way I could get out of it was by slinging my knife around and stabbing, and at one point I found myself with my knife digging into wrist. Sometimes I feel like a scoundrel for not already killing myself....

  I dunno, just wondering if anyone has been through something like this and how they got through it, and if the pain was ever worth it in the first place to live?

---tl:dr---

   I dunno if these next two years of life is worth living for a probable dismal future afterwords, or if leaving the ""organization"" now for a more possible flop, but instant happiness is the way to go, or if I should simply kill myself for a release of pain. Currently, I'm feeling like crossing out number 1 right now, and deciding between two and three...

"Not Sure What To Do - Feel Like Burden to FriendsHi, I don't really know where to go with this or start it, and I'm pretty level headed right now, but I know that won't last for long. I'll constantly shift from wanting to kill myself to really happy and easily excitable. I feel like I come off as a drama queen and that I'm just being melodramatic, but when I do reach those lows, I really do just feel nothing but unbearable emotional agony. I've almost killed myself 3 times now, but each time I'm about to send out the suicide note, I break down in tears and can't do it. The 3rd time, I didn't even shed a tear and felt hollow, so I was worried that I've become desensitized to it since I think about it in detail almost daily for the past month, and after talking to my friend about it, I finally broke down and didn't go through with it. He convinced me to finally throw away the noose I've been holding onto for 2 months and I thought I was done with it.

Now, instead, I feel even more pressured and nervous because I don't have my guaranteed easy way out anymore. I'm afraid I might turn to less clean methods if I get bad enough and botch it, feeling nothing but pain for a long time before dying, or not even dying at all and being crippled and in pain for the rest of my life. I cannot afford help. I cannot afford the medical bills if the police forces me to stay in a hospital against my will. That'd just cause me to finally go through with it as my life would be over after the bill, as my insurance is one of those rip-off plans to not get fined more than how much you're putting in as premium with a crazy high and unreasonable deductible that I'd be homeless from the expenses if I actually was unfortunate enough to hit it. Last night, I had such a meticulously planned method, the only thing stopping me was a reason to need rope that was chill and wouldn't raise suspicion. The way I approach it is just so cold, empty, and calculated that it's kinda' unsettling. It's not this passionate and irrational need to kill myself like when I hit my absolute lows where I'm laying in bed and sobbing uncontrollably. I have those moments but then I'll just sit there for, like, 15-30 minutes just planning it out. I feel like I *need* to kill myself at this point.

The problem is that all of my friends care so much about me. Like I'm insanely lucky with how thoughtful and caring my friends are. Even my ex-girlfriend still cares deeply about me as a friend. After I made the mistake of coming to her after the first time I almost went through with it, I went quiet for 2 days over Discord and she called me while I was at work just to make sure that I was okay. Two or days ago, she was sitting in a hospital on the other side of the world and about to go under for her sexual reassignment surgery, something she had been wanting her entire life. Something that she saved up and slaved over for the past 5 years, the entire time she's ever worked. Despite all that, she took time out of her day to worry about me. Asking me if I was okay, and telling me bullshit when I told her I was fine. She knew me way too well. I couldn't bare to ruin her moment and didn't tell her what was up. And she's not the only one. My two closest friends who I talk to daily are both going through a lot.

One of them has Addison's Disease and is constantly in a lot of pain, always sickly and always tired. She needs 10 hours of sleep a day to not feel exhausted, and that's not a guarantee. The other is a friend of the first's, who is going through a lot right now. She doesn't talk about her personal life a lot, and is generally really withdrawn about her life, but what little I could piece together, she's really ill as well and is also having a very rough life that puts my borderline poverty to shame. And those two still worry about me. They comfort me when I'm upset and are the most understanding people on the planet and they both make me happy when they're around. Both of them are online though. All of my friends are actually. I have acquaintance coworkers who are pleasant, but no close friends. Either way, I feel selfish for going to them when I'm upset. They both encourage me to great success and I feel blessed to have them as friends, but then here lies the issue: I feel like they are a burden.

All of my friends actually. Despite being transgendered just like my friend who I used to date, they are all so supportive and treat me like a woman in ways I don't get in person, despite knowing. They understand that my mood is all over the place because of all the estrodiol flowing through me daily (I was at 100 pg/mL before getting increased by 50%). One of them even compared me to a moody teenage girl. But despite all of the support they give me, I feel burdened by them. After the 2nd time, I couldn't bear to give them a suicide note, so I instead left the Discord group with only us 3 in it (me, the one with Addison's, and the one who doesn't speak about her personal life) as well as all of the servers we were in together. I then uninstalled Discord on my phone and computer, hoping to just sever my ties with them and never burden them again. I started to feel worried about upsetting them, and reinstalled it on my phone a few hours later, to find that one of them had messaged me asking if I was okay, and that was the first I told her I was suicidal. She comforted me and I felt myself settle down (those two are really good at knowing exactly what I want to hear to calm down and feel happier), and the other reinvited me to everything after she woke up. The first had also told the second that I was suicidal so now they both know.

But here's the part with them burdening me. The 2nd told me to never leave because she'd miss me dearly. It made me feel loved, but at the same time, it made me feel that I was obligated to stick around for their sake. I care about them both deeply. They're my two closest friends in the entire world. I honestly even think I'm falling in love with one of them, but I know it'd be a mistake and don't pursue it. I'm also sure she's already taken, as someone as sweet as her cannot be single unless she wants to be (and if she wanted to be, then she wouldn't change that for me). Either way, the last thing she needs is me bringing her down more than I already do. It's not like I want to be away from them. I just...I feel like they don't realize how much happier they'd be without me, since all I do is bring them down when I'm upset almost fucking daily. They refuse to accept that I'm fucking toxic to their happiness and well being with how upset I get when I come to and confide in them. Sure, we all have fun together during my highs and whenever they're active and I get to talk to them, but I highly doubt I'm that enjoyable to be around that it's worth the emotional pain I put them through whenever I'm sad.

I didn't leave any servers just now, but I did uninstall Discord again. I know I'll be clawing at the thought of reinstalling it when I level out again and stop being in the dumps. I just know that I'll keep the vicious cycle of being depressed around them up, but I'm worried that they'll worry about me. That it'll upset them, and I care too much about them and all of my friends to put them through something like that. They all know I'm suicidal because I made the mistake of telling them, and they'll think I killed myself. That's why I'm so torn. I feel like I'm not in control anymore. That I have to stay happy for them. I have to keep in contact with them for them. I have to stay alive for them. I just don't know what to do. Sorry if my thoughts are all over the place. I don't want to worry them, but I don't want to upset them when I'm sad.",,Depressed

 Hello Reddit, i am a 19 year old freshmen in college and i have posted about possible suicide before but i have never posted at r/suicidewatch.  
i am going to attempt to tell you how i plan to end
my life in the fallowing months. because i have posted about this issue several times i will try and just fire off a list of 
some of the problems i have been expirenceing latley maybe this will help me put things into prespective a bit more for myself.

1. for the past couple of months i have been thinking about killing myself in various ways, hanging myself comes to mind a lot as well as overdosing on the 
medication i take for bipolar disorder and ulsrative colitis. i feel as if life can only get worse from here and the univeres/God (whoever) has proven this 
point by puting obsticles in my path relentlessly for the past eight or so years of my young life. the smallest things really get to me these days its crazy
nothing seems to go smoothly as it should and honestly im sick of it. I am a boarderline beilever in god in some way or another and for years i put a lot of
faith in the scriputre of :
 ""For I know the plans I have for you,"" declares the LORD, ""plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.""
but the longer i stick around the longer i begin to realize this may not be true as the last few years of life have been stressful as all hell and i am
left to wounder whether i have been abondon by god or just have a very unlucky hand given to me. (the debate of whether YOU belive in some exsternal entity is
up to you but this is MY ballpark and i am simply describing my journy so far) i seem to have very bad luck for some reason, things alomost NEVER work the way
i want them to. i want to better myself by getting a job? horrible manager. i want to lose weight? ta da you have a desiease that makes things twice as compicated
to lose weight. you want to get to school on time? boom!! roads are blocked. you want to write that paper thats due for class? boom!!! computer has suddenly
frozen and has to be sent back to manufacture. want to have a loving mother and father who love one another forever? boom!!! mom loses her marbles and does nothing
but sleep all day and cry and trys to get a job but ends up coming home quiting everything she tries and is emotially unstable and you have
to take care of her and youre little brother while she crys all day. oh you want to get out of bed today
and do something productive? boom!!! looks like youre bipolar disorder suddenly gets worse at the worst possible time when things should be happy and productive.
oh you want to better youre bipolar disorder with medication? oh well guess youll go through 3 diffrent kinds only to find that they wont work and you need to 
find yet another medication. want to do something as simple as just take a well deserved rest? welp i wont even grant you that. i feel very unlucky at the moment 
and these are just a few exsamples.

2. the reason for constantly daydreaming about killing myself could be due to my mental heath rapidly decaying right infront of my eyes (literally) for the past few
years there have been instantces where i hallucinate constantly, ill see people who arent there, ill hear my name being called, ill here echos of my parents
arguing that happend months or even years ago, ill hear screams, sometimes in unison from unknown people, voices will travel around my house from my ear and
end up right in my face getting louder and louder until they suddenly stop. sometimes i see shapes in the air or bugs/spiders on the wall that arent there i once
hallucinated so badly i thought a man in a black suit with a handgun kneelig down on one knee was going to kill me. these happen less often then they used too but
still they feel VERY REAL to me and i rarely ever have any sort of peace of mind. Some redditors have said that my house could be haunted but i doubt that. sometimes
i see glowing letters on my wall but this could also be glow in the dark paint from a previous owner of my bedroom. i have also had several mental breaks throughout
2015. in April just before i graduated highschool i had this weird feeling that sort of 'clicked' in my brain and i went to a park with a knife and held it tightly 
to my throat after writing a suicide letter that almost came out of the blue. i had another sudden 'click' and just stopped and went inside a starbucks
 dazed for a few hours parents not knowing where i was. I sometimes randomly start crying for no reason and pull out a switchblade and put it to my throat/shoulders
or genitals (thinking fuck...why would i need these if i never get laid right? might as well take away any hope of it while its still fresh in my mind) but never
follow through. im too much of a pussy.

3. Nothing makes me happy anymore this is another reason to kill myself, the older i get the more i realize that everything is vanity, i used to burrow
my sadness and hardships with material things but not even they keep my intrests. family is really all there is besides freinds and mine seems to have suddenly
evapurated right infront of me. therefore i might as well not have one at all. i am concidered ""upper middle class"". that lable comes with its stigmas
but the one thing ive learned is that nothing can make you happy if you dont have peace of mind. a nice house? a nice car? a pool? videogames? poof!!! vanity all
hallow, hallow things we use to destract ourselves. the biggest mistake ive ever made is counting on material things to make me happy and i took a lot
for granted until it was no longer there. for years i had that shitty teenage attitude of ""oh im a nerd oh im a loser oh im not popular"" and wasted my highschool
years sucked up in that and the pressure of graduation and wasted my time feeling sorry for myself when i could having been having fun. the same goes with
family i wasted my time infront of little screens and TV's taking my family for granted until one day poof!!! they're either dead and i never fully realized
how much they loved me or they end up loseing there minds and no longer function like they used too. they arent the same person. this so far, is one of my 
greatest regrets. im sure to have more to come if i continue on.

4. Hard work does NOT GARENTEE SUCCESS. i dont know how else to put this so ill use myself as an exsample. In the past i have worked hard towards my goals even with a learning disability in my way i was
able to plow through with good old fashioned work ethic (i have increadible work ethic...or HAD incredible work ethic i should say) and achived my goals. from
six years old and on i wanted to be a writer and so i worked at it and boom during my sophmore year of highschool i publish my first book and i get 5 Star reviews
 all across the board, i publish another at 17 and get 4.5 stars and then im concidered ""gifted"" at writing. All of these great things, publishing 3 websites, free games,
good reviews, ex. but you know what? with all that good there is bound to be opsticles, nobody gets a free ride in life. NOBODY. book sales are horrible, websites seem
to deminish, and money gets tight. sure .75c a month from book sales with good reviews might seem like success to some, i actually SOLD something right? WRONG.
im an entrepenure, a self made, self starting, hard working motherfucker who wants to SELL SELL SELL and collect on the back end as much as i can. im hungry,
i want to fucking eat, i want to eat doing something i love, but guess what? so does EVERYBODY ELSE. Ive learned that you can have all the talent in the world,
all the reach, all the right stuff and still be a failure. and god forbid we get prideful in our accomplishments. thats another thing i regret. for a while in 
highschool i thought i was the mother fucking rap god of poetry/journalism/writing, i thought i had titanium nuts, sure i seemed humble on the outside but i felt untouchable on the 
inside. i thought ""uugh what she wrote was horrible i could write it better than that"" flooded with possitive compliments frome every which way i was batheing in
pride but truth be told i probably have written some petty, horrible stuff. as
soon as i graduated highschool i got a nice kick in the face and the sunshine coming out of my asshole suddenly disapeared and i was left with a cold reality :

- Moms sick/ cheated on dad
- Dad's Sad/ stressed
- little brother is sad
- books wont sell
- youre going to lose youre shcolarship 
- you have a stomache desieas AND bipolar disorder with a little anxiety throw in
- money is tight
-youre jumping job to job because you suck at everything and keep getting threatened with the possiblity of termination even if you work hard
- youre aunt and uncle, the only people who came from a place you did when it came to education and mental hardship are DEAD and you didnt appricate them enough
- youre prideful asshole of the year and beyond
- you might have testicular cancer and will find out soon and the odds are stacked against you.
- you might be going insane like mom.

5. My will to keep going seems to deterierate every day that passes, sure i can look at the possitive, im thankfull that i get to learn these hard leassons
as a very young adult and not later on when its harder to grasp, im thankfull i have just enough gas to get me to work, im thankfull im not homeless and mom 
is at least TRYING to get better, im thankfull that i lived at 1 pound 14 ounces as a pre mature baby who was told he would die, im thankfull my throat
wasnt cut when i was put up agaist a wall from a stranger who shoved a knife into my neck, im thankfull i have a little brother i can love, im thankfull im 
living another day. but sometimes it just feels impossible to keep going when you just feel sad and want to give up. ive read self help books, tried working out,
saw a counciler and a psychologist, went on long walks, tried religon, none of which seem to cure me from bipolar disorder and how to manage it. the only person
in the entire fucking world i care about at the moment is my little brother, is he ok, did he get to eat today, is he getting a good education, is he emotinally stable,
does he have enough in HIM to keep going, is HE warm at night, is He safe, how can i help HIM. but even he seems better off without me, the two of us live in
two very diffrent worlds, he is very liked and has a lot of freinds, hes the life of the party and i am mostly alone during my days, quiet, and shy.
i imagine the both of us in 10 years. He would be a sucessful doctor (he wants to be a doctor) living in a nice mansion with his gorgeous wife
 and i would be the weirdo older brother who either asks to bum off him with the spare bedroom in his big fancy house or the brother who killed himself long ago.
 we are both gifted artistically and intelegence wise in diffrent ways. 
i just feel like i got the bad end of it, unlike me he has no known learning disability or mental problem, hes able to save money,
always gives ME good advise like the smart person he is, almost always has streight A's and has never had to deal with bullies or teachers telling him he was stupid.
He's also handsome and smooth as hell and is freinds with alsmost all girls. we are very oppostie. still i love him more than any other members of my family. And if i
end up a failure at least i get the chance to see him blossum into who he was meant to be.

6. Ive noticed i have problems taking care of myself more and more as time passes on, sometimes all i do is stay in a dark room all day and sleep, i wont take
showers for days at a time and shaving almost never happens, i go out for walks but only late at night, i gain more and more weight and over eat or starve myself for
days not realizeing i havent eaten.
and i purposely take up bad habits in hopes that i might die soon (like smoking cigars or purposely gaining weight so i can die of a heart attack at 40) changing clohts
is harder to do sometimes i stay in them for days and most of the time i just dont care if i smell bad or look horrible in pubic or how clean my cloths look because
ive just given up in general and dont care.


7. My Suicide Plan - so all of this dumping of everything i fear, feel, and am learning leads up to this simple question, ""how do i decide to end it all""? 
i plan to have one last holiday with my family before i leave this world, im planning to be the most generous, happy, most loving motherfucker there is before
i hang myself from a bridge on a trail i walk when im stressed out, the drop from the bridge is high enough where my body will just dangle above the ground. i want
to get my little brother some good gifts i want to tell my mother i love her, i want to tell my dad thank you. i have already written my suicide letter and plan
on giving all the money from my insurance to my brother (its not much but should help in medical school) ive been giving out compliments to strangers
(i like youre hair, ex.) ive been giving money to the homless, and i even sighned up for the reddit gift thingy thats going on this year so i can give some stranger
i dont know a good christmas this year, ive also joined opperation christmas child and given a shoe box to someone in another country. all i want for christmas
is to see the new starwars movie before i go out with a bang (litirally...i might use a gun instead) because Starwars reminds me of a simpler time when
i was younger and happy and everything was ok and i didnt hallucinate and didnt have family troubles or stress. i really like starwars as a kid. im ending it all
in january of 2016. if the universe/god couldnt help me with all this horrible stuff as a teenager then imagine how horrible life will be when im REALLY out in the 
real world on my own. honestly i dont want to wait and find out.

contrary to stigma im not all sad all the time, im actually kind of releived that its all over soon, i actually laugh and smile now because i know im getting
off the roalercoaster pretty soon and wont have to deal with the pain any longer. im very possitive when i talk about my death these days its not something i
fear as much anymore. im still hesitant to kill myself a bit because i have a small hope that things will get a little better but that hope is so small it could
be blown out like a candle at any moment. let me repeat IM STILL NOT 100% SURE IM READY TO DIE.

IF THERE IS ANYONE OUT THERE WHO CAN GIVE ME SOME GENERALLY GOOD ADVICE (PREFERABLY SOMEBODY 30 OR OLDER WHO KNOWS A BIT ABOUT LIFE ALREADY) THAT WOULD BE GREAT
I STILL MIGHT WANT TO CHAGE MY MIND LAST SECOND. DONT TRY AND FIND ME. DONT FIND MY IP ADDRESS I WROTE THIS IN A PUBLIC PLACE. DONT SEND ANY UNECESSARY HELP TO MY DOOR. I JUST WANT ADVICE.
THANK YOU. AND HAVE A GREAT THANKSGIVING.

"I like such a disappointment to everybody""Suicidal""
It's such a scary word, but the meaning behind it represents how I feel. 
I've always just wanted to be appreciated, to have someone feel proud about me.
I'm taking Duel Enrollment College (In the future, if there is one for me.) And my parents don't bat a single eye, but it feels like the second I mess something up or don't want to drop what I'm doing immediately, to go work on home improvement, then I'm just a lazy, selfish, disappointment. 
Day after day I listen to my parents complain to me about each other, ""He doesn't realize how much I work"" ""she's lazy and wants me to do everything"". It wears me away, the way I get screamed and yelled at for thing I have no control  over. 
Maybe I'm not ""Suicidal enough"", the fact that I'm not standing over a noose at this moment means my issues aren't worth being here. But for a few months now, the thought of ending it all just seems more and more present in my mind.

"holy shit idk if this is depression or just sadness but it sucks so much lemme give context. school started to base classes off of student performance. basically the US grading system but its ranked and youre in a class from a to f. if you did good in the exam then an a-c is garuanteed but if its shit like me then its an f. 

thing 1: ministry of education said not to divide like this but they wont enforce it so my school is advantageous of the problem. not the exploitation but the fact that i got grouped with people i want to stay away from. i literally changed my class just to get away. 

thing 2: grades. my grades are shit and i wont rise up to an e class till like a month which is still pretty bad but its my hopes

thing 3: groups. since its 8th grade people are grouping up to make friend groups. this started rapidly in 6th grade but took extreme effect in 8. i was affected and also just left out which was the largest contributer. although i do hang out with 3 people on a common/decent occasion its just not enough. 2 of the people are in my class and the other is in b. the 2 in my class just get repetitive and the other one in b is pretty much the only one that is talkable without repetitiveness

This part below is about the grandfather coming off a big high. Taking another hit. And then getting arrested by the police. This is his version of that story. Hes telling it to his grandson.

--So there I was. At the base of a mountain. It was quite a surprise to know that i was just all the way at the top. Looking down on everything. The houses. Trees. Everything looked so much smaller. I felt a lot bigger in a way. A lot smaller in others. Anyways, that doesnt matter. I was at the bottom, and I had to pass through this valley to get to where i was going. The only problem is that id heard of this valley before. It was supposedly filled with all kinds of horrible creatures. All kinds of things hidden in the cracks of the unknown. Dusk was in a few hours so I thought I might as well make a little headway. I decided to start walking. 100 feet in.. 200.. Then a mile. I came across a stream. I could hear the water falling onto itself. Swishing past the rocks. In fact now that I think about it I could hear many things. The cries of the crickets. The trees makings sounds out of the wind. The birds. Cawing in the distance. I could feel the wind. Feel the grass beneath my bent knee. I opened my canteen and dunked it into the river. Refilling it for later. God only knew how long it would be until I found water again. I took a sip and walked on. As the hours passed i started to feel a little fuzzy. Weird. It felt like something was watching me. But not in a scary way. Not like it was preying apon me. In a way like how a kid would look at a toy. Like I was some sort of entertainment. Like I was amusing. This feeling just seemed to be growing more and more until i can feel it peeling at the back of my neck. Soaking out of my pores. Something was.. off. Something was.. wrong. I walked on. Then I slowly started to hear a faint hum. It was nice. Soothing. Like a perfect melody. I started stepping to the beat. It kept growing louder and louder.. until it was all that I could hear. Then suddenly.. Silence. The melody was gone. Every other sound was gone. I heard nothing. A being appeared in front of me. It was.. purple. That's the only word I would use to describe it. Not necessarily because it looked like it was purple. But because I could feel that it was purple. I seemed to be experiencing some sort of synesthesia. The very essence of it's being felt purple. Then.. this creature took a step toward me. RED. RED. RED. Frightened, I took a step back. I ran. This creature leaped at me. Grabbed me. Its arms started growing. Twisting around me. Encapsulating me. I blacked out. As I awoke all I could see was white. I didnt feel weight. I was.. weightless. Though I could feel pressure all around my skin. Like the air was hugging me just a bit too tightly. I decided to walk around a bit. No matter which direction I went I seemed to always end up back in the same spot. I was... trapped. 
I became anxious. To the point of suffocation. Paranoid. Or was it something else that was suffocating me? I found myself clawing at my airway. Trying to break free. Fighting to survive...

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I was about 12 I had thoughts about suicide, I was severely depressed and it became the norm for me to think about it daily - although I never planned on acting on it, then. Through the years my periods of depression came and went, sometimes for a month and once or twice for a full year (2012, 2016). Do to the fact I would think about this so often, it had normalised it in my head - or only now do I realised I normalised it. The past few months have been particularly bad for me. I've lost my job that I loved, have had to move out from my flat back to my parents and been diagnosed with ADHD. And I'm finding it really fucking difficult to find a job, or at least one that is as creatively fulfilling (I'm a designer). I've been processing a lot of things recently - and have been thinking about it a lot - not with any intention. It's now affecting me in my day-to-day - I find it really hard to find motivation because at the back of my head I feel like thats where it could end up, its inevitable, its been staring at me running through my mind for all these years and I just never acknowledged it so.   


Ontop of that, something changed last night. I had been thinking about it alot before I go sleep, I cant seem to help it it just happens. I have always processed it alot, but not with any intention. Last night when I was lying in bed, it was like a wave or something and I dont know what happened but all of a sudden I became completely comfortable with it. Like, 100%.   


I don't plan on acting on it, but I'm finding it really hard to shift this 'inevitability' from front of mind. And **that** scares me.

I'm sorry I don't remember the conversation because it was too old and it was on an account that I deleted. but what I understood is that op has been dealing with an abusive partner and she already left him but she want to come back to him or something and make him stop porn and live a good life with him. there are more disgusting details but I won't say them.  

&amp;#x200B;

basically I told her that she can't return back to him because he would still be abusive to her and treat her in a bad way. I spoke to her for about 3 or 4 hours that day and just told her that she should not go back to him. I didn't mind helping anyone at all and that's why I decided to speak to her. basically day after day, we speak about it and sometimes she tells me that she feels like she missed him and he is good and I would've to talk to her for a long time but honestly, I loved it. that spike of happiness when someone tells you ""thank you!"" or ""you helped me so much!"" is just worth it for me. every time I speak to her, I feel like I just helped someone leave an abusive relationship and that could've been living in it for a long time. now I don't want to say that I did anything big but I like to believe that I helped in a big way. (at least from what she said to me).  


we spoke day after day and one day she told me what my discord is and I gave it to her. basically when I gave her my discord,it started being a little more personal. I spoke to her about what happens in my life like closely every day. and she always had great responses and opinions. one day she sent me a photo of herself and ..... idk man. she was beautiful. like I can't even describe it. I spoke to her a lot that day. I was like on top of the world that day and had like one of the best sleeps that day. now for this next part you have to know that I come from a Muslim background. now after searching a little more, I understood that there was nothing wrong with this. but I didn't know that then. the next day I sent her a very long message which was basically that I want to end all of it. but at the same time it had like "" I will be here if you need me"". she asked me if I wanted to end this friendship and I told her no it was just kinda of a recap or something. now I admit that it was kinda twisted and I totally understand what she meant.  


it was kinda awkward speaking after it but I believe that everything just returned back to normal after like the 3rd time. yesterday, I opened discord and found out she unfriended me and changed her username. I don't understand why but I opened her reddit and found that she has a past in being a predator. now I didn't realize that you shouldn't judge people by their past but I honestly felt very angry because 1) she unfriended me after all this time without saying anything. 2) she has a past in being a predator and she never told me about it even though she knows I'm way younger than her. we spoke about how bad predators are and I told her that I had predators in my area so at least she could've had empathy for her ""friend"".  


I sent her a not so friendly message which I should've not sent but I wanted to know her part of the story. she ignored me. I deleted it and told her that I understand that she wants to end it. the only thing I want to know is that why she did it?",,Stressed

And i'm terrified i've missed something in this process. There was some information buried on the school website that really wasn't clear, so I'm scared there's something else.

"So I had to have my colon removed... Warning: some kinda gross stuff ahead. We’re talking intestines and stuff. Not every disease is pretty.

I’ve been dealing with an indeterminate colitis for a while now. The doctors weren’t exactly sure what it was, but after some tests the consensus was that my colon (large intestine) had to be removed, otherwise I would probably bleed myself to death.

My operation was yesterday, and the funny thing is that my incisions barely hurt at all but my shoulder fucking hurts like ass. Doctors said it had something to do with an oxygen buildup and was completely normal and should clear up in a few days.

For the next six months at least I have an ostimy, which is a small opening in my stomach that leads to a collection bag. They couldn’t just reattach my small intestine to my rectum, because both parts need to heal first. It’s going to take some getting used to but I know I can handle it. Shitty thing is, since we don’t exactly know what my condition is, we’re not certain if I can be reattached even after the six months to a year of healing. It’s not entirely off the table, but we just don’t have enough info at the moment.

Some doctors are going to take a look at my colon and we should get a much better idea of what we’re dealing with.

Understand that life sucks sometimes, and you might have to go through some shit. Never let it drag you down. Understand that I was in a lot of pain before this. I had abdominal pain, I want absorbing food, and I had almost zero energy. I was on a bunch of different meds and none of them really had any effect.

My quality of life now is going to be way better, and even though I have some new issues and a “new normal,” it’s all for the better.

Just promise me one thing, you know that kid you pass in the hallway? The one with some sort of weird device hooked up to them, or an eyepatch, or headgear? Don’t make fun of that kid. They’ve been through hell. Sure, I’m taking my changes well, but I sure as heck would hate being called “the kid that shits out his chest.” Be accepting. Life isn’t always roses and the last thing some people need is to be ridiculed just for being healthy.

So last July I started dating a girl. Not gonna go into details but she had an abusive relationship with her ex, nothing physical just verbal and emotional manipulation.

So, today her sister told me that she patched up with her ex. I don't feel angry I just feel disappointed. I would have preferred if I heard it from her. After all the things she was put through by him I just don't understand her reasoning. A part of me doesn't want to understand and a part of me knows they won't work out. She is just gonna hurt herself again and although its not my responsibility anymore, I guess I just feel pity. I guess it just feels weird, to care for someone and they subconsciously going back to someone who f\*cked with them on a regular basis not that while ago. She chose to go back to him and I am gonna end things but I just wanna know why. I know there are some psychological reasons as to why people who have been in ab\*sive relationships go back. I just want to know why she would do it? I can't think of any sound reason as to why she would go back.

Do I block her from all social medias and ghost her completely and risk not getting answers or should I confront her about the situation?

"Suicide is an option, but not now.1) I want to thank Reddit for just being such a helpful, fun and lovable online community. You guys don't know how much a little goes along way, you don't. 

2) If you can't get what you want, I really do not see the point of life.

Here's my situation:

I've been going to a Junior College for 5 years ever since I graduated in 2006. I quit Junior College as I have no motivation for it whatsoever anymore, seeing old friends who've transferred into UCs, graduated and got jobs gives me a strong sense of worthlessness. A loser. I hold on to the fact that both my parents and grandmother never went to college but have great paying jobs in which they are their own boss.

I live with my grandparents, at 24.. My parents are pretty old and I know that when they die that I pretty much have nothing to live for if I don't have a secure job and life.

I've applied for a job (see other posting) and apparently I found out today through a reference that unfortunately, a ton of ""ghetto peeps"" have that job. We come from a pretty good neighborhood and forgive me for discriminating but if some morons who are trend-bitches have this and I don't get it.. well.. how fucking absurd, really.  


Speaking of which, as much as I have charm with the ladies.. I cannot stand seeing the biggest jackasses with the hottest girls. Trust me. This kills me.. it kills me bad and I wish I knew what it was (despite my charm) that got these gals. I would just like to increase my charm ten fold and get some of the same women these assholes did just so I know I have that ability, as petty as that sounds.  


Overall, my philosophy is pretty bleak as well. I was raised religious and I learned what ""evolution"" and ""survival of the fittest"" was in High School. For a very religious person that is breaking out of it, hearing ""survival of the fittest"" is the scariest thing in the world. The meek shall NOT inherit the earth, they die, get used and abused. Observation to me says assholes are the winners and all these lies about Armageddon coming and wiping out the wicked people got me thinking I didn't have to worry about anything. I could be wrong.


But I generally believe that life happens by chance and fate is somewhat true. Some people are born with the genes of success and intelligence. Don't believe me?

http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/more-proof-that-intelligence-is-85134.aspx

http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/science-scope/genes-intelligence-linked-for-first-time/9738

The arrogance of some people just makes me want to rub this in their face to let them know that their upbringing and genes determined who they were. Nothing else. And even if their poor decision making resulted in some bad situation that they still had that shit to fall back on. Sorry, this is off topic.

Nonetheless, I have very few friends as well. I've gone from group to group and have been isolated and hated and abandoned.. It's complicated and would just be an endless page of explanation. But for some reason this doesn't bother me as much as I've learned to accept what comes to me and realize that some people are meant to be this way.


Don't get me wrong.. I don't want to kill myself but I feel eventually that will be the only option deciding whether or not I have a shitty life or to just rest in peace. 

**TL;DR:** Suicide becomes more prevalent to me if none of the following are fixed: Moving out, becoming financially independent, my grandparents proximity to death and also learning how to have the charm that assholes do with women.",,Depressed
"Personal Discussion Log #4: General Update/Life Here we are, day #4! I'll admit that already I find myself struggling to think of topics to write about. Should I just do my daily occurrences? Random topics? Or anything in between? Well, that's all beyond me for now, today, I think I'll just calm down a bit and take things as they go.

Yesterday's D&amp;D session went pretty well! One of the players ended up not being able to show, so I had to play his character for him, but I'll fill him in on what happened later. I'd say we all had fun with it though, and one of my friends stayed over after that to spend the night. It's just about 10:00 for me now when I'm writing this, I think he's still asleep in all honesty, so I'll try and finish this before he gets up.

As for today, I don't really have much planned. I just got onto school break and I don't have much homework to get done aside from a few things in my literature class. We're doing a unit on poetry right now, and although we do this in school what seems like every other year, it's pretty fun. I have to do a biography of a poet of my choices life, then do a spoken word reading of one of their poems, and make an essay analysis over that poem as well. I ended up picking Dante Ahleghiri, and I'm covering his poem Sestina. Aside from being in Italian, it's really just a normal poem, I'd recommend reading it if you're into that kind of stuff. 

All that aside, I guess I have a haircut later today as well? I've planned on changing my hairstyle for a bit, but I talked with my hairstylist the other day and I think I'm gonna discuss it a bit with her today. Right now my hair is honestly really just bland, thick, and a bit messy, but I plan on thinning it out and growing it a bit to get that sort of early 2000's skater kid fringe haircut kinda style going on. My mom isn't the most on board with it, she likes my hair as it is, but she supports me on it nonetheless, which is something I can't say every kid gets the opportunity for.

Then I think that'll just about do it for today! I'll admit this entry was pretty uninspired compared to whatever else I may be doing in the future, but it never hurts to just have a regular update or whatnot. I think tomorrow I'll focus on some questions, and try and answer any you all might have. With that being said, that'll que my leave, I hope you guys all have a great day! Seya! :)",,Normal

"Talking about random stuff: Day 92 Man, it's been little over a year since a joined Reddit.

Sadly, the first thing I did on Reddit was join r/PewdiepieSubmissions. As many of you know, it's just full of stupid circlejerks and reposts. I left it a while ago, and I glad I did.

Felix himself is not a bad guy, he's rational and self-aware. But his fanbase is fucking annoying, especially his subreddit. For example,   there was this stupid Twitter drama over his Spotify playlist, and some artist tweeted that he didn't want Pewdiepie to listen to his music. It was a shitty thing to say, but Felix blurred his name and said he didn't want anyone to go after him. 

I'm not on Twitter, but in the youtube comments, people were asking for his name and going after him, contrary to what Felix wanted. 

Well, half of the subreddit are actual nine-year olds, so I can understand all the circlejerking. Little kids do what they see, what they think is cool, and you can't blame really blame them.

"I need some advice about school and a girl So, I’m going back to school in September and it’ll either be online or in person with whatever measures Alberta decides. If I do go back, I’ve got a good half-face respirator and a metric fuck-ton of P100 filters. I had all that before the pandemic, don’t ask.

I’m lucky enough to have the choice between online or in person school. This is kinda bad because there’s this girl who I kinda like. I don’t have any of her contact details or anything so I have no way of contacting her. I’m pretty sure she likes me too or at least used to. Haven’t spoken to her for quite a long time, probably not since January. I don’t know what she’s doing but I should find out next month.

If I go to school in person and change my mind about things, I can probably switch to online. If I do online school and change my mind, I might not be able to go to school in person depending on the measures they put in place, especially if they’re doing the whole “go in person these days, do it on your computer these days” thing. 

I’ll probably go to school in person if they do the thing I mentioned in the end of the last paragraph. Only problem is is my parents think that I don’t want to go to school. I could certainly convince them to let me but I’d need to make a good excuse and the conversation would be extremely awkward. I am fucking horrible at math so I’ll do that class online regardless of what I’m doing due to the fact online math classes are easier than ones in person. I’ll actually be doing grade 10 and 11 math next year if it’s possible so I can get it out of the way. Thankfully I don’t need grade 12 math for a political science course in university!

My freshman year was both shitty and pretty fun. I made an ass of myself, made people laugh both with and at me, and most importantly I barely passed for the most part. Grade 10 is when shit gets real. I really hope that I get myself together next year.

Where I live, there are barely any cases of the Wuhan coronavirus but very few people have the brain cells to wear a fucking mask. My school will almost certainly mandate masks so I don’t need to worry about that. Plus, I’ve got the respirator and if need be, I’ve also got a full-face version that uses the exact same filters. So, should I go to school part-time and wear the respirator, or just stay at home and feel like absolute shit for another year or more?

TL;DR: I own a respirator (2, actually) and have many P100’s. School will open but we will only be allowed on certain days in different groups.

I'm not one of those 'edgy nihilistic teenagers' - I believe what I believe is rational (to some extent, aha). If I am completely honest, I struggle to find pleasure in many things but I've always been like that, so I see life as work, work and more work until you drop dead. Yes, I know it is more than that, but that's essentially what we do. For what reason? Don't ask me. I'm thinking about whether I should just get it over and done with or wait and see what my future has to offer. I'm just bored... really, really bored. ",,Depressed
"DisconnectedI work at Starbucks. I get to force myself to not be me and its good because then I'm just not really there. I take a step back and go through the motions and wear the mask of a happy and okay person, but I live inside my head and its not a nice place to be.

I don't really have feelings any more. I haven't for a few years. I feel disconnected from my body. I can feel completely neutral and numb in my mind, but my body will be in hysterics screaming or crying. The worst part is I cannot even explain this properly because how the hell is it believable that a mind and body aren't in sync and that even though it looks like I'm letting emotions out and feeling things, inside is just a black hole numbing my everything.

I've tried therapy. And medication. Medication and therapy. I've been doing so since the 6th grade. It was supposed to get better, but it isn't. No matter what medication I'm on (and I've tried a shitload) it doesn't help me to feel. I can't feel. I can't connect to myself. It drives me crazy and I honestly don't know what to do.

I don't really have a support network. I was with my girlfriend for two ish years and before that she was my best friend since we had met in the 8th grade. It just wasn't working. I don't have my father in my life, and my mother is in no mental state to offer support or comfort of any kind. She's in a particularly aggressive manic state of her mental illness. She is a good mother, don't get me wrong, but she's so broken already, she can't help me. I've tried asking her for help, and it just breaks her down more.

I don't have any close friends. I don't really socialise much, and don't have a way to meet people. I'm not in school right now since I could not afford to. My co workers and I have different opinions and morals, so we don't really mesh in the friendship area.

I've been told I should try going to groups for people with similar issues, but I've tried that as well and its just a room full of broken people reminding me how not okay I am. Is it really so wrong of me to just want a group of friends who don't use me as an emotional dump to complain and unload everything on? I just want to be around people who are okay and positive sometimes.

It might seem like I'm overly dramatic, but truth be told I really truly do not have one single person I can spend time with to just not be alone and left with myself. And I'm really fucking terrified of myself. When I'm alone I just don't feel anything and am just not afraid to die. I just want to stop existing and disappear. I have to use every ounce of energy to stop myself from falling off my balcony, electrocuting myself, turning the steering wheel and smashing into the cement walls head on at 120km/h on the highway...

I don't want to hurt my mother any more than she already is, but I don't want to be alive. I wish I could just do it and stop being so empty and disconnected from everything, everyone, and myself. The only thing stopping me is hurting people and messing them up. But right now, I think I'm at a point where even that is starting not to matter. And I'm scared of myself, reddit. I am.",,Depressed

"I feel like i dont deserve my friends at school.I feel like i dont deserve my friends at school. 

My friends give me their trust and make me happy, they are supportive and always help me when im in need. But a while ago i made a big mistake that i feel will ruin my relationship with them completely. I had some friends in elementary and i was harassed and made fun of by them.   


When i got into middle school i got some new friends, they were more experienced and mature than me. I had to make up lies to fit in with them, but i feel even if i didn't they would except me. My lie that would mess everything up in the future was I had a boyfriend. The person i liked. I faked an entire relationship with him. This was abt 11 months ago. Mt friends knew who the guy was but they were not close or had any contact really. What made my lie believable was that he was 2 years older. After a while i wanted to stop lying to them, but i was scared that my past friendships would be the same as this one. So i told them that he had cheated on me at a party and got a girl pregnant so we cut ties. They believed me and didn't really bring it up for a while until...

About 4 months ago i came out to my friends saying i liked a girl. The girl felt the same way and we went out for a little bit. Later she told me that she lost feeling and she wanted to break up. i was really sad by this and went to my friends for comfort. They comforted be but the topic of ex's was brought up again at that time i wasn't thinking of the future. Now that i have been home and away from people i realized what would happen if my friends found out. And abt 2 weeks ago i noticed i was falling for my best friend ( straight). I knew that me and my fake ex would be going to the same school in 1 year. Im getting scared of getting caught for my awful mistakes. I would be in 9th grade and would be in 11th. I feel that i should cut myself off from them before i get hurt in the future. Im not sure what to do. Im really hoping they forgot everything because of corona. Im even considering faking amnesia so when i do get caught i would not know what they were talking abt and maybe they would forgive me.",,Depressed

"Methods and resources to help deal with thoughts of suicide that don't require therapists and medication?Hi /r/suicidewatch,

I have been struggling on and off with suicidal thoughts for almost a decade now. The only thing that's holding me back from killing myself is my family. My family has been very good to me and I love them very much. Regardless I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts due to other factors in my life.

I really want to get help so that I won't cause any grief to my family. I've tried therapists but they don't really help much. Some of them actually make me feel even worse afterwards. I also don't like speaking out loud about my feelings, especially to strangers like therapists, who otherwise wouldn't give a shit about me if it wasn't for the job they had to do. My oral communication skills aren't that great. I'm not very articulate and I always trip over my words, so I end up sounding dumber than I actually am. Also, I hate the fact that some therapists will automatically label a person as ""crazy"" before you even have a chance to speak about your problems. I'm just a normal person who just has a shitty problem, and so I want to be treated as a normal person.

Another reason for being wary of seeking this kind of help is the stigma that comes with things like this, and the fact that this kind of history of suicidal tendencies and visits to therapists can be used against me (i.e. for work, relationships, etc.)

Does anyone know of any coping mechanisms or other alternative methods that can help me? Most resources for suicidal people are for emergencies, or are short-term and are not anonymous. I rather that my friends and family not know about my problem. I want to be able to guide myself out of this (mostly) on my own like an adult.

If you need more background, I am currently in my 4th year in university, with two majors: one in the STEM field and one in the arts. But the job market is shit and I will probably end up working minimum wage for the rest of my life, which will be a huge disappointment for family, friends, and everyone else who knows me. So the horrible outlook for my studies/career is very demotivating. In terms of hobbies, I make art. Art is also completely useless and doesn't contribute anything to society so that's also demotivating factor. It just takes up space in my room and it drains whatever money I make, so there's no point in doing it. 

In addition to the uncertainty in my future in terms of work, finances, etc. another factor that contributed to my depression was the constant bullying and harassment I received in school from the age of 4 until my first year of university. I developed some self-image issues and social anxiety because of this, so it's difficult for me to trust people and make friends face-to-face, which makes things even worse.

I know that many more people have worse problems that they are dealing with and have better reasons for killing themselves. I'm sorry that there are other people in this world that have to suffer through worse things. 

I simply don't want to live anymore just because I don't feel like it. I just don't like life. I don't like the fact that I was forced into being alive. I don't like the fact that I have to stay alive no matter what. I wish life was optional. And I wish that my life and death wouldn't have an effect on loved ones.",,Depressed

"I just need someone to talk to. I need help. I would like to start off by saying that as of right now, I'm not not planning to kill myself, but I have been to too damn close too many times. I just want to talk to someone, get some input, and share my thoughts. Here's my story:

I'm a 17 year old guy in my last year of high school. I have good marks, and a good family, I love them. It's just that I have been noticing a trend in my life. I know I have never been a talkative guy. I'm the guy who doesn't want to say anything to others because I don't want to feel embarrassed.  I have a couple good friends, one I've known since I was 3. 
But I feel that my life sucks. Almost every day, I go through this phase of just hating everything in front of me. right now, I wouldn't even consider the friends I have now as true friends. I have always thought that friends are suppose to have your back. Mine don't, they make fun of every mistake I make. Im a short guy too (5-7), a little overweight too, and people make fun of my height, even my friends. It just doesn't feel fair. They are good people, but I just don't feel happy around them. I constantly don't want to be around them, don't want to talk or hang out with them. 

That kind of goes for everyone. I like being alone. I only feel safe when I'm alone. I look forward to sleep every night not because Im tired, but because it's the only place where I feel safe and comfortable...a place where I'm away from everything. It's been getting worse too. It feels like I have no one in my life who I can lean on, besides my parents. No one outside my family loves me. I get put down constantly. Heck, I cried myself to sleep last night! Because I want love, I want a good life, I want true friends... But none of them are available too me. And I'm surrounded by people who have all these! Everyone in my school seems to have someone, something that's keeps their life worth living. Thats the reason I don't want to kill myself. I want to be loved, I want a good life, but I can't get that because of myself. I don't feel loved, I don't feel needed, and I can't pull myself together to get them. 

Sorry if I'm confusing you guys, I'm finding it really hard to explain. It just that I constantly feel hurt, that I'm alone, and that I'll never find someone to help me. I try to talk to people, but I am never confident enough. You might think I'm shy (which I am), but I'm more then that. There has to be something wrong with me. Everyone around me doesn't feel what I feel everyday. While I said that I don't want to kill myself, it doesn't mean I haven't thought about it. Every day I think about it, and force myself to make the choice. It's hard. About a month ago, I had a belt in my hand ready to go. I was ready, but something made me stop. I don't want to hurt people. I never have. I've always been as nice as possible to others. I just feel like life is not moving in the right direction for me, that it never will. I just don't have it in me to convince myself that it will get better. I can't change *that* much. 

Sorry if this was long. I just needed to tell someone. I need some input. I don't even know if I'm depressed, because I feel good some days. Its just that there is this inexplicable sensation inside of me that makes me want to escape and run away. I'm going to university In a different city this fall, so I hope that I can try and build a new ""life foundation"" and start from scratch. it just doesn't seem possible that there is anyone in the world who *actually* cares about my life, who loves me, and who wants to see me happy. I want to meet them, and I better meet them soon.

Her parents don't allow her to have a phone, so she was only able to talk to me a little bit over quarantine. Well, her parents found out she had a secret phone so she hasn't been able to talk to me In months. Well, the first time I heard from her in months, she says, hey, it's me, ________ we need to talk. I get super nervous because that's really nerve-racking to hear. She says stuff like having a long-distance relationship isn't healthy, it's just best if we're friends for now, and at this point, I'm in tears. I'd just been broken up with over text, not hearing from her in months. I was really hurt. I got sent to the counselor because my 1st-period teacher is a really nice lady and got worried about me when she saw me crying the entire time through the class. She later said something like I've never felt this way towards anyone before, I still love you, but when I go to high school maybe we can date again (because I'm a freshman she's in 8th grade. I started dating her when I was an 8th grade she was 7th. Don't think I'm a weird dude) but this hurts a lot.

"Right now I feel lostPeople always tell me that I am important to them. Words are just that. They can incline feelings and emotions, but they can't make me see, or feel any specific way. I've been having feelings of depression for about three years. I am 16 years old, a sophomore in high school. The problem is I don't feel like I have anything to be sad about, but that is the only emotion I can feel. Everything else is an emotional numbness that doesn't allow me to feel anything other than lost. I have friends and I have the support of them. They were by my side before and after I came out of the closet. My parents love me, and my brothers are there every step of the way, offering support as I struggle my way through life. I feel like the problem is myself, and the lies my mind is telling me. I'm the only person that I can trust, but unfortunately what I tell myself to do is not good. I started self harming about a year ago to deal with the emotional distress. It felt like the only way to express something I couldn't put words to. The only thing that makes me feel like I have a purpose is that I have the power to end my life. It's like the only thing that I have that gives me a purpose. I am completely in charge of what happens to me. I want a future, but the voices inside my head aren't in agreement. I guess I just don't know why I feel this way, or why people would even care about me.",,Depressed

"Is my family toxic or no? Let’s start with my mom, basically my mom has kicked out my sister, threatened to kick out my oldest sister, never taught me healthy eating and I used to be so stressed that I would binge eat everyday and I am lucky I’m only 20-30 pounds overweight. She never takes us anywhere and I don’t know how to socialize. These are only small things, let me start talking about the bigger things.

One time somebody in the family apparently ate the rest of the ham she saved up so she kicked the door and trash can and started yelling about how everybody in the house are ungrateful brats or whatever. Recently but not TOO recently I had a breakdown where I wanted to k//l myself and when I told her to leave me alone she just broke into my room, yelled at me, threatened to take me to the mental hospital and told me my crying was being dramatic and then when she finally left she just told me to be quiet and kicked my door.  She also tells me to just calm down when I’m having a panic attack where I literally think it’s all over...like that will help? She’s done a ton more but to be honest I cant remember.

My dad....he’s mean to me everyday, he used to bully me for my weight, I’m trans FTM and he calls me a girl pretending to be a boy as if I would ever want to be trans....he tells me I’m abusing the cats even though I dont, and every time I’m around him he ALWAYS has a mean comment. Also one time I was trying to do a math assignment and I couldn’t do it even when I looked up the question so I started crying because I was super stressed so he came over and slapped me.

Finally, my brother, he thinks being gay is a choice, he’s transphobic, he was the first to see my cuts and told me to cut vertically, he makes fun of my weight even though he is underweight. He’s so nasty, his room smells like piss and musk and its so messy and he doesn’t wash his hair, brush his teeth, or wash his hands after he uses the bathroom.

But I’m hesitant about them all being toxic because my mom doesn’t barge into my room without permission, or search through my phone and she isn’t transphobic and she feeds me and shelters me.

My dad is occasionally nice to me

And that time when I was crying after my mom yelled at me my brother actually came in and comforted me.

"what even am II gave up on life when I was nine years old. Stopped doing homework, stopped going outside, stopped trying to make friends. I was lonely. But I had no drive. I had no motivation to change anything about my life, and I was too fragile for my parents to force me into anything. I spent more than half my life in complete isolation from society. I didn't develop any social skills or any identity. I was, and still am, a nowhere person. The closest thing that I have to a soul is meaningless personal preferences and an undiagnosed case of narcissistic personality disorder.

Now, add all that to the fact that I'm a cancer patient, and that I have hypersensitivity so severe that my father's voice feels like knives in my ears, and you have everything that I am. I have achieved nothing, I specialize in nothing, I love no one. I don't know how to feel things for other people. I don't know how to like them. And I don't know how to stop feeling so angry and lonely. No one can give me a straight answer of how to do it, and no process leads me to a point where I can figure it out on my own. I am too crippled to reach out for any in-person service, and too stupid to make enough money to live comfortably. All I do is binge eat and beat myself until I can't feel anything anymore.

"Feeling miserable again and I'm not sure how long I can endure itRecently my (untreated) depression has returned and I (16, have been experiencing symptoms since I was 12) have spiraled down again. I'm not certain if it's because it's autumn or because of stress, but I've been feeling utterly miserable, hopeless, chronically exhausted, unmotivated. I have very few close social relationships but I strained the one with my girlfriend and broke up with her due to being depressed (impulsivity, mood swings, trying to distance myself from people) and now I'm not sure if things can ever be the same again. School exhausts me and I struggle to find the motivation to keep up with it, and unfortunately the things that brought me joy and a reason to keep pushing forward no longer do. I see no point in my future and the wicked, terrible state of the world is one of the reasons. I wish I never existed so I would never have to experience this (despite having what is considered a good, lucky, privileged life) and so I wouldn't feel so guilty about bringing grief to whoever has an emotional attachment to me. My mother is the only parent I live with and I can't talk to her about my depression very often due to her struggling herself and because she thinks I choose to be this way (my depression isn't real and I'm just lazy). Part of this is because she is often stressed herself and always has a lot of work to do, both in the household and because of her job, and unfortunately I often lack the motivation to help her out with it.

I've been having suicidal thoughts lately, despite coming to realize that it isn't an option to me since I don't know how to execute it, I'm afraid of the pain of dying, my suicide would traumatize my family way too much. I really don't want to have to consider suicide as an option, since I don't truly want to have to end my life, but I'm tired of things being this way for so long.

"Need advice on how to help my suicidal friend(16M).Hi, I'll be using made up names to try and not confuse anyone reading.Thanks :) 

A friend of mine named Chris began having suicidal thoughts and started self-harming, when he found out that his ex-friend was flirting with his girlfriend and talking behind his back. 

So it all began, when Chris made a joke about Dylan and sent a picture of him to a bunch of friends. That's when they started drifting apart. Dylan would always talk behind Chris's back after that, putting him down and making fun of his depression. I talked to Chris on the day he had planned to commit suicide, since I didn't know what was going on between the two, until Chris sent me a suicide text.

He calmed down and decided that suicide wasn't the right option after our talk. I also found out that he had told Dylan's ex that he was a fuckboy in retaliation.  

Chris is also a child of divorce and is in a dysfunctional family environment. He isn't being physically abused, but his mother wasn't there for him emotionally whenever he needed her. 

The harassment from Dylan was basically, just him making fun of Chris and his depression, which influenced his group of friends to do the same thing. He's been called out a few times by some people within the group, but besides just a, ""Hey that's not nice."" That's about it. I guess you could call me a coward for never sticking up for Chris. I'm just timid and have social anxiety but that's not an excuse...  

I've personally had my glasses taken without my permission and the frame broken, because of a 'joke' by Dylan. I guess looking at this now, he's a bully disguised as my friend... 

Anyways, just a few days ago, Chris texted me saying how he was going to end it all again, because his girlfriend had broken up with him, supposedly the only thing in the world that made him happy. Chris started cutting and Dylan started making fun of his cuts.

I talked to Chris again and comforted him. I also learnt that his girlfriend chose to broke up with him because she was talking to Dylan despite, Chris asking her not to, because he's someone that's been harassing him. She then claimed that Chris was controlling her and that was the end of their relationship. 

They're going to start dating again and I've been warning him that she might not be the best person to be with and that we don't necessarily know what love really is since we're so young. Chris's girlfriend is also a controlling person, at least that's what I've heard. 

So I guess my question is, What should I do? I've asked him a few times to see a professional, but he claims that it doesn't help and seems hesitant to seek help. 

I'm also sorry if my grammar or some of my sentences don't make sense. I'm just tired since it's late and have been anxious. Thanks!     ",,Depressed

Called 911 broke my family’s hearts and went to a mental hospital. All I got from it was anxiety and meds. I stayed on my meds for 2 months before I wanted to end it all. So I almost did. Took the bottle of meds and them promptly spit them all out in the toilet. My parents were disappointed in me. Took away my freedom and thus therapy began. It did nothing, we never talked about my problems. So once COVID began my parents ended my therapy. Now, waiting for August when I start 7th grade. I’m ready to end it all. I have done every way of feeling better. Meds, therapy, self harm, attempt suicide. Nothing happened I’m only alive for my cat. I’m just ready to go.",,Depressed

"Anyone got tips on killing oneself?I've been suicidal about 12 months. Done the crisis housing, tried starving myself, have sat crosslegged on main roads, tried to OD on an assortment of drugs. Guns are impossible to come by in the UK. The closest I've got was when someone tried to mug me with a knife and I pointed to an area on my neck I'd like the to puncture and they ran. 

I was in crisis housing when I was hysterical. Violently upset, and impulsive. Now I'm mellow and just bored. The equivalent would be if I was about to being engulfed by a ball of fire would be: Hysterical 'Oh Fuck!' - My current bored self would stare blankly at it. 

Life isn't bad. It's just not worth it. Like a Michael Bay Movie, I'm in the movie theatre and I want to leave. It's just not for me. I have good stuff going on, I just find it very hard to care. 3 months ago I quit smoking weed. Thought it would help my suicidal urges, nup. Kinda made me wanna go more, as being stoned would make me think about shit that isn't to do with my life until I ran out and had to be sober. 

I moved in with my girlfriend, and thinking it was a great relationship, I fear her coming home. I make dinner, but she's not hungry yet and can be aggressive even though I tried to do good. 

I have a cool job, but the amount of pressure I'm under to excel my career is crushing. I also can't identify the areas of my skill set to develop to succeed either. It's the job I've always wanted, it's the dream job because if I did anything else for my living, I'd have driven into trucks at 90mph on my way to work. It's the only think I can bare to think about doing. 

I have no hobbies. My job is often misunderstood as a hobby. I play music as a career. Don't want to get involved in sports incase of personal injury. Used to like video games until I completed fallout 4 for the 10th time and realised I've achieved nothing. 

I feel misunderstood, obsolete, useless, bored, miserable, impotent, hopeless, scared, left out, sick, ashamed, more feelings come to me and different times. Usually when I think about one of all the aspects of my life I'm positively sick of. 

I like diazepam, weed, and painkillers for drugs. Anyone know a combo that's lethal? Don't want to go out wrenching or sweating my nut off on anti-depressant a MDMA. A gun would be cool if I knew how to get one with out it being risky as balls. 

Don't really have friends that aren't my girlfriends friends are musicians I play with. Parents are as emotionally intelligent as the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket on this subject. Ive spoken to everyone I can and nothing makes it better. Ive moved cities, I've quit my addiction. Life is still black or at best grey at times. Everything is more work than its worth and I just want to cease to be. I smoke 30g of tobacco a day beckoning the cancer to my lungs, I eat no veg the rare occasions I do eat. I am not helping myself stay alive.

"I'm 25 and my life is crumbling before me. It hurts to even get out of bedThis is going to be a long story, but anyone who goes through it and reads it would be REALLY appreciated.

Okay. So at the age of 21 I was convicted of a felony and was sentenced to 3 years of probation, technically 4 years since 1 year was spent on bail. Because it was a computer fraud related crime, I wasn't allowed to get a job or anything working with computers unless it was approved by my PO, which it never was. I worked regular 9-5 jobs. One of which was a cashier, one was in food service, and my last job before I got off of probation I was a pizza delivery guy. At first, getting put on probation sucked, but towards the middle and end I was actually really happy. I had structured schedules, made lots of good friends, the whole 9 yards. Things were going great. Until I got off...

So a friend of mine who owns a company out in Houston, TX offered me a job out there making $800 a week with room/board doing regular IT stuff a few months after I got off probation. I got the job in November of 2014. The schedule was really laxed, and I could pretty much come and go as I pleased as long as work got done. A few months later (early March 2015), I was able to move back to my home state and work from there. Because I moved back home, I barely got any work done. They stopped giving me assignments and then stopped giving me my weekly payment. I'm a 10-99 so I can't really report it to the BBB. 

Oh yeah. And on top of that my best friends/roomates from my home city got another roomate while I was gone to TX for a few months, and when I moved back to my home state, I had to move back in with my parents. That's right, I'm 25 and living with my parents like a pathetic loser.

Losing my job, or at least seemingly losing it, happened today. Which that's what crushed my soul... But let's get on to something else that's making me feel like absolute shit...

So last year I met this girl through a mutual friend while hanging out at a buddy's house. We were really cool. In fact, later on she ended up asking me out. We hung out for a few months, then I stopped hearing from her. Then shortly before I got off probation, I heard from her again. Yay! And we even hung out a few times when we got back in touch. That was up until February. I had no idea where she went, or why she stopped contact. Oh well, whatever. Well, come to find out, she's in jail and has been locked up since February. I figured out because her mom randomly messaged me on Facebook saying that she wanted my address to write me. Then later told me about her heroin problem. (Details of that story is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/31l9jg/update_friend_of_mine_23f_seemingly_disappeared/)). That was over a week ago and I have yet to hear from her. Then again, she is in jail. I should be more patient. Either way, she was really cool and I really liked her company. We hung out quite a lot. But it seems like that is gone too. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't have anything to make me happy. I have no job, barely any friends. All my best friends have written me off because I'm too depressing and all of my new friends, well, i don't know that well. And that girl I was talking about, sure she's a new friend, but we had a really tight bond. Many people didn't like her or I for separate reasons. But we were always really close regardless of what our mutual friends thought of us. I honestly don't know what to feel anymore. I'm starting to think I'll forever be alone. ",,Depressed

"Am I sexist for being scared of women? Okay it's not like a phobia or anything, but I'm a little scared of people and in general more scared of women. I've been bullied by both genders, here's some experiences: the boys who bullied me hit me. It wasn't rare for them to make me bleed and they made me bleed since kindergarten. But I was manipulated, betrayed, used, ect. by women. Of course I understand not all women are like that, but I'm more scared of getting bullied by women. I can fight back if hit but women are more likely to be passive aggressive. Of course, I know that not all women and not all men are like this. But in general if a woman was bad she'd be more likely to insult you and a man would be more likely to hit you, and I'd rather be hit to be honest because I see pain as a learning experience (I do not see others pain as a learning experience and I do not think it's okay when they're bullied.) and it hurts a lot more when my self esteem gets ruined. I myself am non binary (Assigned female at birth), and I do not think women are all bad or men are all bad. But as I'm more afraid of people in general, I'm scared of getting bullied again and more scared of getting bullied by women (I'm not saying women are more likely to be bullies.) I don't think all women are bad or all men are bad, but I would rather be bullied by the average man then the average woman. Does this make me sexist?",,Anxious

My mother has had norovirus. She vomitted once on Wednesday morning, 7am. It's 00:51am now here, Sunday morning.

Since I heard her vomit, I went into defense mode. Staying in my room, not eating at all, after using the shared bathroom I'd used Germ-X to wash my hands - I didnt want to touch the taps to turn on the flowing water, or even be in the bathroom for too long for fear of catching it. When I did venture out of my room (she was sick but still using the rest of the house) I'd still sanatise my hands. I thought I was protecting myself.

Welp. Turns out Germ-X doesn't kill norovirus.

I'm not afraid that vomiting will kill me, or anything like that. I'm solely afraid of vomit. I'd rather die. I'm having frequent panic attacks, stomach cramps - although I know that might be because I havn't eaten much apart from some crackers I keep in my room.

"Quick psych tip for your personal life Med student and hopefully future psychiatrist here. 

While doing some studies I was reminded of the jdea of problem based coping and emotion based coping.

I know when I was a teenager (and hell even through undergrad and now) I misused these.

For example:

Emotion Based Coping: eating icecream and playing video games after a break up because it makes you feel better.  - good use of emotion based coping

Problem Based Coping: working on a project your stressed about to get it out of the way to relieve your stress. - good use of problem based coping

However, I find myself doing this often:

Emotion Based Coping: Eating Ice cream and playing video games to deal with the stress of a project I need to do.  - bad use of emotion based coping

Problem Based Coping: working on trying to get my ex back after a break up. - bad use of problem based coping.

I recommend being able to identify what problem your facing and deciding what is the proper way to handle it, it will save you a lot of frustration later and make you handle problems much easier.",,Stressed

2: Complimenting specific parts of our look (eyeshadow colour, good contour job, complimenting an accessory.. etc..) is the best feeling ever because it feels like it was worth it to put the effort in to the little details. 

3: You are not a simp if you tell off someone who is clearly making us uncomfortable. Maybe don’t be too much like a knight in shining armour, but the protection feels really good. 

4: Don’t watch porn. Seriously. 

5: We enjoy coming over, even if it is just to watch you play video games (at least I do), just be willing to answer questions or socialize. 

6: Shower. 

7: Take pride in how you look. Dress up nice. 

8: Regarding the last number, “surfer boy” style is really popular right now and almost every girl LOVES it. 

9: Work hard in school. An attractive boy is okay, but an attractive boy with good grades is 🤤🤤! 

10: Be willing to turn down the boys for us. Not all the time, but sometimes. 

11: Sexist and/or racist jokes are a big no-no. 

12: Don’t expect sex. 

13: Don’t be afraid to make the first move, we can usually tell that you are interested but don’t know what to say. 

14: Being good with kids and animals is one of the biggest turn-ons! 

15: Be spontaneous. 

16: Please don’t follow instagram models and like their thirst-trap photos. 

17: The worst feeling in the world is seeing other girls comment things like “where are the photo creds 🤔?” or “my caption was better🤪” and especially “there, i commented” on your pictures. I can’t explain it very well, but having someone constantly need to talk about how they were there is blood boiling. Trust me. 

18: Don’t turn off snap maps after you say goodnight to us. 

19: Laugh at our jokes. 

20: Don’t compliment us by saying “omg ur not like other girls🥰🥰”. Just don’t. 

21: Clean your room. 

22: Vaping in the school bathroom is one of the biggest turn-offs. 

23: Don’t be mean to teachers. 

24: Send the homework if we need it. We will remember it. 

25: Tip well in restaurants. 

26: A man who can cook is just 🥰🥰🥰

27: don’t pee all over the toilet. also, put the damn seat down.

"75Today is the lowest point in my life. My husband left me for someone else last month, and my son cried when he had to come back home with me today.

I tried reaching out to a friend and the conversation ended with him telling me I have serious issues within myself and then they stopped talking to me.

I had the worst anxiety attack I've ever had. I thought a shower would help, and it just led to me laying on in the bathtub crying and struggling to breathe until the water ran cold.

The only thing that calmed me down was the realization that my mother has a cabinet full of medications that could easily end it.

I tried using the suicide hotline chat and there were 75 people waiting before me. I chain smoked for 45 minutes and gave up when I was 34 in line.

"I'm sad and the lights have gone out.Idk if this matters, but 19 year old female in post-secondary school.  diagnosed double depression, social anxiety, eating disorder (anorexia restricting or nos, it's being debated), bpd (which is also debated), ptsd (being debated with bpd and complex ptsd), generalized anxiety (don't know why psych hasn't mentioned this).  Self harm but not currently active.

Today I did something I never thought I would do again; I turned out the lights.  Since September, I have been unable to sleep in a completely dark room due to some scary experiences I had been having.  I have very bad insomnia, and at the time nothing was working.  I would be stuck in state of extreme tiredness but mind too active to sleep.  Nothing seemed to help.  My mom gave me Nyquill to try in addition to my prescribed sleep meds that the doctor couldn't change.  The nyquill helped for a bit, but it got to the point I was taking 3-5 sips a night (which is about 150mg-250mg of the drug).  It became too expensive and i switched to the pill form which was cheaper (sleepez) which also didn't help.  So I kept taking more and more to the point I would take up to 11 a night at 50mg just so i could sleep for a few hours.  Of course, this isn't healthy, so what I was essentially doing was overdosing to the point of getting weaker and eventually passing out every night because it was the only way to sleep.  When I did this, I would hallucinate.  And would lie in bed terrified of the creatures and figures that would appear in front of me.  Since then I have had sleep meds switched multiple times (still not helping) and I have not fallen asleep without a light being on since.  I was too afraid I would see them again(as ionly saw them in the dark) so I would have a light that would light up the room enough for me to see around it on everynight.  I always feel the need to lock my door and close my bathroom door (not completely, with a tiny crack in it) at night.  I haven't been alone in the dark since then.  Until tonight.

Tonight I was lying in bed feeling overwhelmed about life and how I realized that there would never be a happy ending for me.  There never was going to be.  I told my boyfriend I wanted to have a break for a bit, in reality I would just like to break up with him but I feel like his depression would get worse if I did.  I tried breaking it off many times over the time we have been dating.  But he always convinced me to give him another chance.  All along deep down I knew it would end in disaster.  I always knew I would die soon, and I didn't want him to be even more hurt by me.  I do love him, but he's holding me back from the one thing that will bring me peace.

The best moment of my life was last September.  The moments before I woke up in the hospital.  The moments where I couldn't see anything.  I was comatose.  Unresponsive.  Couldn't breathe and my blood was poisoned, my stomach bleeding from the inside.  I had attempted suicide, which would have been lethal if I had not been caught in time.  I don't remember doing it.  I don't remember the feeling of dying or the feeling of someone discovering me (conscious) or the emt's taking me away.  Nothing.  I wish I knew.  When I woke up and realized where I was.  My first thoughtr was ""I was so close""  I was so close to achieving what I wanted for so long.  It was perfect.  Not feeling anything, having no thoughts, no worries for a while?  I wouldn't trade that for the world.  Yet I was forced back into a nightmare I have been living in for years.  I guess you can say I'm resentful of that.

But the doctors think I'm doing better, thats what matters, right?  Everytime she says im doing better and i just stare.  So I must not be as bad as I was before?  Yet all I want now is to die.  I want this all to end, and I know how to do it.  I've been prepared for a while, and have just, I don't know, not had the motivation?  I guess I've been too tired and sick and I'm tired of being sick and tired anymore.  I'm tired of having to keep up with conversations or activities I found at least semi interesting in the past.  I barely go to class, I mostly lie in my bed and use the computer.  And that I don't have paticence for anymore.  I can't concentrate, my stomach always hurts and im starving, but I don't want to eat because I'll be fat and ugly, but if i don't eat my headache will get worse and I won't be able to sleep.  But my head always hurts and I can't sleep anymore.  What's the point?  

The light is off and I'm stuck in the dark, and I don't think that light will ever turn on again.

Tell Brendon I love him.  And that I always loved him.  Maybe in another life we could have had our happy ending, but it's not this one.  Tell my family I loved them all, and that I'm sorry.  My snuggle buddy will need someone else to sleep with now.  Don't let them make her sleep alone.

I'm not afraid of them anymore.  They can come for me and I won't scream.  I won't fight.  I just ask that they make it quick and take me away from this hell.

"Can't get out of financial debt. Thinking about suicide.Hello /r/SuicideWatch

I have been a lurker so far, but as of today, I would like to express my feelings...somewhere. Better here, than telling my family.

I'm 27 and from Germany. My depressions and other psychological issues (including being afraid of meeting people, low self-esteem etc) have been a culprit since 11 years now, I tried to commit suicide a couple times already. First time, when I was 17, last time when I was 19.

I have been in Therapy around 6 times by now (I can't really recall the correct number), switched between several anti-depressants and the Medical Officer I had an appointment with last year, diagnosed me as being ""Unable to work for an unknown time"" and signed the papers.

Since then, and this is really stupid, I compensated this with spending a good amount of money for Gifts for my Family. Ranging from Cigarettes, Sweets etc to PC Games, just to make them happy and kind of feel a bit better inside.

Anway,

This now led to the situation, that my Bank Account is overdrawn. I was able to do this, since I had a small job for a year, where I had an income of roughly 400€, the amount you are allowed to earn over here without having to pay taxes. It was a Home-Office Job. I had to get up at 8 in the morning and work for 4 hours a day. Not that much and I was able to pull it off.

The Bank then gave me a Credit limit of 1200€.

I lost the job after this one year, because the company had to ""restructure"". Meh, they nearly went bankrupt, that's why.

This is what really downed me (next to several other things, like being single and having a lot of old friends around me in a relationship, one of my brothers married).

I'm still living at home and have to deal with it, that my Mom has to take care of me, help me financially, but I just can't ask her for a full 1200€ paycheck to help me even out my bank account.

I just don't know anymore on how to cope with the depression, low self-esteem, the mistakes I made and that I actually kind of did everything to make me get into this situation.

I really wish, there would be a quick way to end it right now, without pain, since I don't want to feel pain anymore.

Is there such a way?",,Depressed

No way to reach out to server members. Finally find some side server with a channel that I can type in and get told to leave and go call a hotline, even as I’m trying to explain my technical difficulties with the server. 

Try to call into work. Boss says “uncontrollable crying” isn’t a good reason not to come in. I ask him if he thinks customers will be ok with me making them food as I actively sob and drip on their food. He goes on to rant about how he wishes he “could cry all the time”.

"Got Friend zoned after talking to a girl for a year and already saying we liked each other First off i want to say i'm not great a writing so please forgive me for any mistakes and stuff.

So I met her at a camp like thing in the summer (4 weeks in total), I had seen her around but hadn't had the courage to go speak to her directly until near the end and it went pretty well, we did a couple of the activities together (like in a team with other people), and at the end of the last day she asked me for my insta which completely caught me of guard because i thought i was doing good but not that good, so i fumbled my words but eventually managed to tell her my insta, so the camp ended and some friends helped me to message her to hang out (to clarify sent from my account just they told me what to put because i'm as autistic as they come) and so we go to see a movie together and she turns up like 10/10 and i'm just there in a hoodie and jeans, but we have a good time. After the movie we went to a park and talked and a some point we both say that we like like each other, so i get home and i'm low key freaking out cause this smart and beautiful woman likes me back. So over the period of the next few months we hang out some more (we live kinda far away so not that often) and she even kisses me on the cheek at the end of one which felt amazing. Messaging each other was kind of limited outside of organising meeting up because hella autism, but in person it was great. So skip to a couple months ago  she asks to do a call and for any normal functioning person yeah easy, but not for me, getting tons of anxiety but agree anyways because i like her a lot. Kinda awkward cause i'm dying from anxiety get through it tho, and do it a couple more times (not any easier) and on the last one she asks me why i'm so nervous because i'm not person, and i basically say using the internet to talk and message gives me hella anxiety and i don't want to mess things up with her by doing the wrong thing, I said it less direct than that but she got what i meant despite saying other wise at the time. So we ended the call and i feel good because i told her, next morning i get a message from her and i already know i gonging to be awful just from the notification because the first word she starts the message with my name like a fucking letter, and i literally collapse in my bedroom and i just start thinking of all the possible awful things it could be, and so eventually after like an hour i read it and its just as awful as i imagined, i'll summarise because i hate re reading it, *Cookie yesterday was awkward, i knew exactly what you were saying but didn't know how to respond to it, i thought we were just good friends and i'm not ready to be anything more*. So yeah that made feel like shit, it took me a half a day to reply and i ended up just saying *oof but ok,* this all happened a month ago so i would be feeling better if life didn't just keep memeing on me but i wont go into that because its hella complicated.

Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height.

The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates.

You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen.

Half brothers: my dad divorced his other wife which left him apart from my two brothers. Because of this he spent more time with my brothers than with me as an infant and little kid. I love my brothers to death but its very noticeable how much stronger their relationship is with my dad.

I am not very confident: i have never been. My dad has always been. Something he may not understand

"What used to scare you in your childhood, and what scared you in the last 1-5 years as teenagers? I remember when I was 6 years old (I think?), I used to be scared so easily from the old Lotto ads from my country, they had those small weird creatures with numbers on them, and they were scarying the shit out of me, using their stupid scream, that at the time, it was like a huge jumpscare for me.
And those ads were even played in the radio! So imagine how many times I had to suffer this stupid scream, over and over and over, not to mention it took me like 4-5 years just to get used to it.
Well, those ads still exist nowadays, but so far they stopped with the scream, so I will forgive them just for that.

So anyways, about 2-3 years ago (I think?) from today, I was listening to some Pegboard Nerds songs, when suddenly I came across their collab with an artist named ""SNAILS"", entitled ""Deep In The Night"", the artwork was pretty scary, but not too much scary tbh, but it was only the beginning, so after listening to the song, I went to SNAILS' SoundCloud page to see if I am interested in more of his songs, and I had absolutely no fucking clue that I would enter one the scariest place of EDM that I currently know whatsoever, so anyways after scrolling down a bit, I came across his collab with a twin named ""Botnek"", entitled ""Waffle House"", and it's artwork, has quickly became no other than my 2nd worst nightmare, still to this day, and that nightmare literally gave me a huge trauma for like two weeks.
I don't even want to say what was in the artwork, if you are curious AF, just search the song on YouTube, but don't say I didn't warned you.
So anyways, the trauma faded from my brain, but I am still afraid if I will ever see this artwork ever again, because I know that if this will happen, the trauma will most likely be back to me.

So these are the two traumas that I remember most from both my childhood and my teenagerhood, But I am curious, what were yours? I would like yo know. :)",,Anxious

"Male Privilege again... I made a post about male privilege earlier, but I didn’t quite explain what it is.

Male privilege is being able to walk the streets without the fear of harassment. It’s being able to walk past a group of fellow men without fear of verbal or physical harassment. Male privilege is feeling safer than women. Overall male privilege is the lack of fear in public, doing things in public without fear. Without the fear of being raped, cat called by a creepy guy on a corner. 

I experience male privilege, and I’ve only just learnt what it is through my sister. Her telling me how she has to be extra cautious in public. She basically can’t walk alone at night without the inevitable fear of being raped. 

I’m looking to better myself, to make a statement for men to understand. Don’t be a fuckwit to women on the streets, imagine going about your daily business. A stranger does something than an instant chill of vulnerability and weakness comes over you. That’s what my sister described male privilege as not being worried by the small things. But for men they may be small but for others they are huge.

Be better boys, for the people you love. Your mother, sister, girlfriend or friends. 

Cut the snarky remarks, try to be less intimidating.

Be better that’s all I’m asking.",,Anxious

"Will Pedophilia Happen To Be Normalized In the Future? Pedophilia is not something new, we all have been sickened or rather even angered by the very existence of it. 

However, in the recent past weeks, a large number of social media accounts, news articles, and even memes have been discussing the very topic of the so-called MAPS (self-identified maps) aka pedophiles and how they are trying to normalize themselves by trying to get ""along"" with LGBtQ+ communities and even going as far as creating a flag to represent themselves.

Personally as a person who is extremely critical to topics of pedophilia and rape. I was sickened and was worried . 

In a recent talk with one of my friends about these topics we saw how people of LGBTQ communities were oppressed and were often hated and harassed by the general public and how it can still be seen in our older generation such as our grandparents and even our peers often labeling them as ""unnatural"".I was told about how just like in the past the people who hated LGBTQ communities are now considered conservative and parochial one day we might be too be seen like this but in this case, it would be due to our disagreement with the very presence of pedophiles.

Countless underaged children are being abused and over sexualize for the sake of entertainment and fame by their parents and guardians and it has provided with a means of media for these pedophiles and you can virtually find child porn in literally any hentai (Japanese pornographic art) labeled as loli available at one click away.

Will in the future after common interaction of people about such sensitive topics make them numb and result in pedophilia to become destigmatized and be a thing of the future and we have to stay quiet about it.

I as a person is genuinely scared and angered with the very possibility and the helplessness I feel.

Please let me know what you think.

tl;dr Will pedophilia become common and ""legalized"" and we will be known as the boomers of the future generations?",,Anxious

All I feel is physical I can sense the heat or the cold the pain in my joints or the itching in my skin but nothing else like some parts are missing inside. When people tell me jokes I just logically process the information but cant feel anything music became noise just secquence of different sounds and pauses. Everything I say feels fake feels learnt, scripted . I feel out of place. I am confused all the time about being human Do I have to live because of an instinct? No death is worse than the best possible outcome of a life then why take the risk. Statisticly there will be a moment of unevitable suffering eventually  maybe a car accident maybe loss of a loved one maybe a disease or anything. Everything what i identify as my personality as my soul is just formed by my given genetic and the enviromental factors that shaped me througth the years than what am i actually? I mean i have a need to have free will because it is coded in my brain but there is no such thing because nothing in me is choosed by me so my thougths and decisions are just reactions for previous events.

ive failed a couple of tests because i couldnt submit them on time. i have 10 late papers that are late by a month at least. im not new to submitting late but i feel even worse now because a lot of people i know are able to submit on time and manage their time well. i just had to have some stupid disorder that makes me lose my attention easily + lose track of time. i also had to deal with processing my trauma with this ""friend"" who took advantage of me and several of my friends -- sometimes i just cry or get irrationally angry because he suddenly comes up to my mind. it's so unfair he gets to thrive in his new college and even gets to perform abroad while i stay in this shitty college that people made me think was good. 

im wondering if i should shift to another college that's more expensive but not as ""good"" as the one im in now. hell, people are only here to pad up their resumes because it's a ""good"" university but it doesn't really care about it's students. i dont know if my parents would accept me shifting to another college because they think the college i'm in is the ""best"" and they don't have to pay for anything. but i know that im probably gonna suffer regardless of the college im in because of my stupid adhd.

I just don't understand, she never talked to us about her problems. but looking from the outside. she has everything I've always wanted. i look at my sister and I see someone who could do anything, excell at anything. She has a large circle of friends, she graduated college on time, got a job straight out of college in the field she wanted, has a boyfriend.  She had everything I wanted to have in my life at her age. . My parents love her more than they ever loved me, and it's not hard to see why. She's everything they wanted in a child. I'm 30... still in school, i can't do anything, I'm overweight and lazy. I've spent my entire life alone, no social network, no girlfriend. She's achieved everything.

Why would she do it, why would she leave our parents with me. why leave them with me as a failure of the family. I'm the one who should of killed himself long ago, but just like everything else. I cant do it, and she can. 

&amp;#x200B;

i don't understand. I'm so alone, everyday is so awful, I sit in silence unable to communicate or connect with anyone. I've wanted to die so many times, but I always told myself it would get better, but it never does, it never did.  I never had love, I never held anyone or been wanted ever.  what was so bad that she did that. Maybe if I died instead of her, she owouldn'tf done it.

I see my parents, they don't even want to talk to me, they don't want to look at someone like me.  I remember so clearly the differences between us. She always had a birthday, friends, mom and dad would give her gifts. I never got anything after middle school. I don't even remember the last time someone wished me a happy birthday. They were so happy when she graduated college, they bought her a nice used car and help with her new fancy apartment in NYC.

When I graduated, they didn't even realize it, they just told me it was about time.

"Funny school story -Salsa Yeah its in the title.  Anyway so in 7th grade my father had brought home like 12 gallons of salsa from work.  Well it was getting to the point where we couldn't use it all in time so as the ingenious solution my mind came up with was bring it to school.

  For about 6 gallons out of eight (We used 2 and we gave 2 to our neighbors) it went smoothly.  Except one day I ever the risktaker brought 2 gallons with me.  The first deal went off without a hitch.  But the last deal when I gave it to my friend the principal saw them with the gallon.

  For some unknown reason the principal took the gallon who knows why only they do.  The principal asked who gave this to you but apparently I chose the right person to give it to because he said I brought it from home like the good person he is.  They took it to the principals office.

 Yet afterwards when I went to retrieve the salsa they said that If no one came to claim it they were gonna eat it with some chips.  The.  Audacity.  I kinda cared but then I thought ""Hmm thats talking to authority and I'm liable to be angry and then get in trouble."".  So like the saint I am I said okay thanks through a bleeding tongue from biting it so hard.

  Finally with the happy ending to this I gave my friend the salsa after school and it all ended happily ever after.  (Sorry for possible bad grammar English is even my first language I'm just dumb).",,Stressed

"my teacher smashed my classmates ""phone"" (sorry for bad english)

i live in germany and i go to a electrical engineering school since a week or so. we have there a teacher that i found pretty unlikable because he constantly behaves like we know everything already and speaks to us like we are dumb kids if we are a little bit behind. like i already said i go to a electrical engineering school so phones are mostly allowed in class, except his class. and so, today, a class mate of mine took his phone out during the class and as soon the teacher saw the phone he instantly confiscated it and started to scold my classmate. but then, without anyone saying or doing anything, he completely flipped and started shouting things like "" we are here not at vacation "" and through the phone at the ground with full force. it shattered in many pieces and the whole class was instantly quiet. i thought that dude gonna beat the hell out of the teacher but no. he just sat there looking confused af. no one could believe what they just saw myself included. and then my teacher starts to laugh like he did the most hilarious prank that ever existed. and then what literally no one expected, my classmate also starts to laugh and then while looking at us he says "" what you guys thought that was my real phone ? "" . it turns out he had an iphone and iphones dont break in pieces like that. at first he wanted to beat the teacher up for breaking his phone but after realizing that it couldnt be his phone he stopped. finally after every one was left confused the teacher says that he bough an broken phone just for such instances and that he put my classmates phone in his pocket then taking out the already broken out and smashing it. after giving him his phone back he said ""no seriously dont use your phones in my class"" and then continued the class. i was left SHOCKED i tell you. i still dont like him but that gave him huge bonus point in my mind.

"My depression has hit the lowest point in years. Only thing stopping a hospital stay is hiding my true intentions from my support team.This week has been emotionally self-draining. No one died. No one broke up with me. No life trauma. But day-to-day bs is finally getting to me, along with my outlook on life.

I see no future. I have a plan, I keep intending to finally take out those knives I'm hiding and do the ultimate deed. Only thing stopping is procrastination. I've marked a 10 severity for numerous days on my journals.

My paranoid schizophrenia is getting to me as well. You know how those doomsayers talking about next month (September 2015) will get to me. And I completely distrust half my support team to begin with. My parents are lying, manipulative and abusive bastards, and the staff here at my GH are the same. I trust my therapist and psych workers, but only so much.

Other than my current psych counselors, my state actually has some of the worst mental health treatment in the country, generally. I know huge motivating factor in actually commiting suicide is fear. The same fear that drives one to jump out of a high rise to his death because of a fire. The same fear that drives bully victims to commit suicide themselves. Deep down, a part of me secretly hopes a similar fear to materialize in some form. But my logical brain keeps reminding me ""be careful what you wish for"" is still true.

But my existing fear is a continuation of my life shituation. Typo intentional. Bully parents. Bully staff. Eternal Forever Alone. Eternal Kiss-Less Male Virgin. Global society collapse. Global biosphere collapse. A world without computers at *some point* in our lifetimes. And a global 1984 dictatorship in much less time.
All these fears are culminating right now to push me beyond the terminal threshold.

I see no future for me. I see no Happy Hollywood Ending. I see no freedom. And almost certainly I see no sex or romance outside of Sims games.

"I’m honestly excited to die of a heroin overdoseFor an extremely long time I had a lot of desire to commit suicide but there was always something holding me back from doing it. I don’t even know what it was to be honest but today I feel content for the first time in my life. I’ve gone through a few counselling sessions for drug addiction and mental health and it was extremely helpful. The people at A&amp;E when I went was the same and my GP too. Couldn’t ask for more but living a terrible life that won’t get any better isn’t worth it. My brain chemistry is probably fucked and I won’t be able to return to normal again and not be depressed. I’m trying to ruin my life as possible as actively as possible. I binge drugs with the intention of losing my mind and hopefully going crazy to the point I do commit suicide because I haven’t got the courage to do it anyway. 


My belief is that there is no afterlife and once I’m dead I just simply won’t exist. No regrets or anything. Suicide DOES fix your problems as far as I’m concerned. I’ll be dead so even though the guilt of putting people close to me through this makes me reluctant to do it, I won’t feel anything towards them anymore when I’m dead so it really doesn’t matter. 


All my problems will be gone tomorrow or if not very soon. I have £120 sitting in my bank account and I might just buy some other drugs that I haven’t tried or just go all out before I’m gone. I have some heroin that I’m getting tomorrow and I’m going to try a few recreational doses first before I fully kill myself. I don’t feel nervous at all and I feel so happy for the first time. I can’t function in this society at all (can’t even do simple things like wake up early) and the life I dream of having is one where I can do drugs all the time without having to worry about other things like money but that isn’t achievable from what I can see. 

Just imagine the rush from IV heroin. I can’t even begin to imagine how good it could possibly feel. I used to dream of the euphoria something like heroin can give someone because it’s a feeling you can’t get when sober or with many other drugs. I’m going to go out on top of the world. So euphoric, so content and so happy. I’ll be unconscious by the time I die so I won’t feel any pain. This is going to be the best thing I ever do and I can’t wait",,Depressed

I know it sounds horrible but it was honestly a great experience. Unfortunately, I was injured during training one was a hand injury (nerve damage) which ultimately lead to my discharge (5-11).

"Am I this horrible person? I want to die.&amp;#x200B;

I have Asperger's Syndrome, and have been prone to OCD stresses throughout life, though I've never been formally diagnosed. Things have been very stressful for me over the last year and a half; an old friend committed suicide, and I found out that an ex teacher is a pedophile. In addition, I was objectified by three different people and a subsequent online relationship fell apart, and it was all too much. I have Asperger's syndrome, and I've always exhibited obsessive compulsions when feeling stressed, such as opening/closing doors a certain number of times, or insisting to myself that I walk while thinking 'good thoughts'.

Eventually, my disgust with the treatment of women and a shame that I was complicit in it, as well as horror towards what my teacher did to others, made me scared of being around children/babies. I’d actively avoid them in supermarkets, and obsessively started putting my hands to my shoulders when out in public and at home, avoid eye-contact with them or photos of them and just not want to be near them, because it reminded me of the worst parts of humanity. The false memories originated here, where, my brain would lie to me and say I’d touched myself inappropriately at this place or at this time, and it would sometimes take hours/days to reassure myself everything was fine and here’s where I was stood and here’s where my hands were, etc.

This has led me to perpetually isolate myself even more, and not want anything to do with the outside world. At some point on I think a Monday or Tuesday evening in the second week of September 2019 after moving in, I basically watched pornography for like 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its height. I would go from grinding against the bed to then sitting up and watching interviews and random videos on YouTube, and one of the videos was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter and the way my brain has misremembered that is that I somehow pleasured myself to this, which I didn’t.

I remember watching another video of porn afterwards and only then did I kneel down to grind again, but with the video loaded. Afterwards, I remember going to the homepage and watching a video slideshow of his daughter through the years and feeling so much guilt for watching porn, more so than ever and the way my brain sabotaged me was to overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of YouTube then porn. I remember going to the sink afterwards and gipping, processing it through in my head immediately afterwards and feeling comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it.

This didn’t reappear again till May 2020, then again this week on Tuesday night, and so I wonder if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just a false memory. Now, the worry reappeared at the end of Tuesday when my brain didn’t have anything else to worry about. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done what my brain tells me I did (or anything wrong, at all). The false narrative that my brain builds up is, ‘well, you’re a psychopath/sociopath/pedophile, and that’s how you were able to suppress the memory for 8 months’.

I know I didn't do anything wrong, it was just that I watched porn and switched to YouTube back and forth, which I never do before, as I usually go for a shower after watching it. I feel a tightness in my throat and stomach, but then it goes when I rationalise it, but then it comes back. 

My brother says that he knows I would never do anything like that, and it's just that all those things have collapsed on me.

Last year and the year before that in the 7th-8th grade I was bullied about my appearance, I look very different from the other students, or you could say for short (Exotic) the school the i go to is somewhat predominantly Caucasian and Hispanic, I’m super mixed with a whole bunch of shit and I’m 2nd Gen American which makes me closer to my foreigner roots. Everyday that I went to school they would ALWAYS talk about my nose and say that I had a witch nose and point and stare at it during lunch, it was so embarrassing. I would usually sit by myself at lunch too since nobody liked me, or they thought I was “too weird” and I always ate school lunch since my moms home cooked traditional meals embarrassed me and “smelt nasty” to the other kids. The bullying got so bad that I tried to take my life before my 14th birthday, I just thought that I couldn’t take it another year, I also go bullied heavily online as well, the name calling and threats wouldn’t stop at all, and I think one of the students posted my nose on the internet and made fun of me.

"since i can finally post, i need to rant for a bit about my friends and d r u g s i have this new friend at school, he's a super adorable trans boy calked alex and i hecking love him so much

basically, i asked him to hang out with me. his mum said no, and later that night, threatened to take him out of the school because of me wanting him to come out with me

hes a very over protected child, too. he doesn't smoke, drink, or do drugs, unlike most people at my school (its a very small school for autistic people, stoners, and dropouts)

so today, me and my other stoner friends invited him out with us, and we were gonna leave at lunch time. we begged his mum to go, and she still said no

now, another thing is, one of the methheads at my school, who is the ex bf of one of my best friends, is harassing everyone in the school, especially kids who know nothing about his drama thats going on rn

he harassed my baby alex this morning, and i was worried he was gonna do it again, so i wanted to take alex, especially because if we all left, he'd have NO protection from psycho bitchface

but me and my stoner friends left and said we'd come back to speak to alexs mum in person to see if he could come out. but a few hours later, alex called us, screaming and crying

apparently his mum said she'd take him out of the school, said that alex was a bad child (he really fucking isnt, and shes super lucky she had him as a child instead of ME or ANYONE ELSE IN MY ENTIRE SCHOOL), and misgendered my poor boy constantly

so now, i honestly wanna bash the shit outta his saggy tit 70yo looking plastic mother. ive been crying for most of the night since i got home, thinking about how hes probably gonna get hurt by his mum and how he might get taken out

after that, we haven't heard from him, and im worried asf about it

another thing, unrelated to alex: after we left school, we tried to accumulate $30 to get a bag of weed. it was pretty easy, and me and 3 others left to go to our beloved SeshBush™

one of them walks up to their dealers house, which lives around there. she gets the weed, and comes back. she starts going off about how its underweighed, and that the bag was only worth $15 when we paid for $30

so basically, we got fucking ripped off and the weed was gone in an hour because of how little there was, and now im pissed off",,Anxious

My medication has fucked me over. I forgot to take it yesterday and when I went to bed and when I woke up I felt like I had the worst hangover on the planet. Until I took this mornings dose I felt like shit. But I can't come off it because then I will feel even worse. It's also making me Schizophrenic. I just.... fuck.

My 'friends' just backstab me and make me realize that they don't really care about me. Once we take away them because they obviously don't care I am left with one person, Mom. She's handled the death of a child before so she can deal with it a second time.

There's no way I have a future in anything I want to do if I can't even be happy. My High Functioning Depression is taking over and I really don't know how long I have left. I bet if I was to take my own life no one would even realize the battle I had going on in my head.

"Antidepressant not working anymoreI have been taking Lexapro for the past 5 months and, while it certainly wasn't a miracle cure, it was helping a lot. I felt less anxious and depressed; I no longer woke up thinking about suicide and I could leave the house without worrying about a catastrophic fire the would kill my cat. In the past couple weeks, though, I have felt old anxieties creeping back. I have had to block out certain thoughts because they were triggering me and found myself becoming fearful of leaving the house again. Last night, my suicidal thoughts came back with force. I have been up all night pondering suicide. I've decided that, as soon as my relief staff gets in at 7:00am, I'm going to the ER. But I must admit to feeling a bit dismayed. After 12 years of psychiatry and therapy, I finally found a drug that was working and then it quits on me in less than 6 months.

"I am a danger to myself but I don't want to be institutionalized (again) - rantSo, I tried to kill myself twice last year. One attempt was via pills, specifically Oxycontin and Prozac. One was with the good ole' knife and sleeping pills strategy. Today, I wanted to go blood thinners, knife and a few bottles of Visine, but I decided to post here right now for the mere reason that I can't even cut myself enough to die/pass out. 

I'm on antidepressants for major depression; specifically Cymbalta. 120 mgs. I am 18. Male. I have friends. I am not a socially awkward nerd. I have had sex with humans before. My marks in school are pretty good.

I have been feeling fine for many months but this past week I've been a wreck. This was somehow (hilariously) triggered from listening to Sigur Ros' lead singer's new solo album into thinking ""kill yourself, you can never create beautiful art, no one will ever love you, your life is meaningless, you are a horrible person, your family hates you, your friends hate you, you hate yourself, you don't actually like anyone, you are a pretentious faggot, you think you're better than everyone, you are cynical, you are falling behind on assignments, school is a waste of time, good marks don't satisfy you anymore, you are ugly, you are awkward, either start using opiates again or kill yourself; die, die, die, die, do the world a favour."" 

I assume you'll tell me to take CBT or something. I've taken that before. I've done that nonsense.

What I want to do is get help of course; but I am not going to a fucking mental hospital again. They have made up the two worst experiences of my life. I leave them a much more shaken and broken person. The nurses and doctors treat you like shit, you sleep on a tiny bed, are given inedible food, have nothing to do all day, and are generally humiliated, emotionally destroyed and tortured for a few weeks. You have to lie to every staff member to have some slight possibility of ever going home - shit, ever going OUTSIDE again. My second time there I made a vow to be successful if I ever attempt suicide again.

Preemptive strike: I don't care how my family feels about me killing myself; they are horrible people and deserve to suffer. I don't care about my fucking friends. I have no pets. Suicide hotlines and such are hilariously useless at giving one advice. Therapists are completely useless. 

So my dilemma is as follows: I, right now, want to kill myself, have no easy way of doing it and seriously want help. **What should I do? How can I help myself?**",,Depressed

"Interested in your inputI guess if this would be anything it's the part left of me that is scared shitless asking for help. Ok, I'll get straight to the points no bs. I don't want to live anymore. 

For the last 6 years or so depression has just broke that down person I once was. I really just don't like who I am..to the way I look to the way I'm socially awkward  and I've always had great friends to talk to this about but 3 weeks ago but my best friend who's been like a brother ever since we were kids committed suicide. I feel just worst I've ever felt because I could have helped him but my mind was so bogged down with how I wanted to end it soon also it blinded myself to what my friend was feeling. We were talking all normally through text up until the day I thought things were fine I know I couldn't have known but I just should have called in person or something.. 

Anyway here I am 3 weeks later it's been day in and day out trying not to scream at work with anger, grief. Nothing will ever bring back my friend you have your great friends in life but he was the one I could tell everything to, laugh about everything to and now he's gone. I just see no way out. Talking is not going to bring him back and talking is not going to stop my other problem of hating and feeling so insignificant to everyone else. I've been through the whole antidepressant thing and they are not for me. So what am I living for? I don't have anything I want to live for anymore. My notes are written Im ready to go tonight. So why am I even typing this? I don't know but if it's for anything it's to tell you to love the ones around you before it's too late. Don't let this happen to you.The feeling is not something I'd wish on anyone.",,Depressed
"M/26, I feel like everything in my life has just been moving from one cage to another.I'm posting this here because I keep drifting towards thoughts of suicide. I thought I was beyond all these thoughts, but recently they've resurfaced, and hard.

I feel trapped. And it's bizarre because, on an intellectual level I used to think to myself ""There's no point in suicide, if shit's that bad than dropping everything and starting over is still a better option, worst that can happen is you fail, and since you were planning on dying anyway, what's the worst that can happen?""

But I guess that only works as far as the world will let one start over. I am not in crushing debt, but enough to keep me in place. I make enough that I can survive, but I'll be paying off my loans for years, and every month my credit card situation gets just a little bit more shitty.

I just, I want freedom. I'm a slave to the grind. I'm not interested in romance. I don't care about money. I just want to be able to pursue my art, my writing, and my spiritual practices (I'm buddhist). 

I hate my job for no reason other than it's not what I want to spend my time doing. The things I want to spend my time doing don't pay the bills. And I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life in this endless cycle of depression and taking one step forward and two steps back.

And the stress of it all is physically screwing me up. I get these episodes where I feel drunk. My body feels heavy, and my mind starts racing, my sight gets blurred. And I know it's psycho-semantic. That I do it to myself, but I keep coming back to that point.

I want to be free. I feel like we're all enslaved by society, and the systems made to keep us in place. To keep us providing. milking us. I can't not work a stable boring job because I have debt to pay for an overpriced education I felt forced into.

I don't want what other people want, so I'm constantly an outsider. I can be sociable. I'm well liked at work and amongst friends, but there's a disconnect. A divide that can't be bridged because money, sex, and love are 90% of their motivation for living, whereas those things don't matter at all to me. But I have to wear this mask to keep my job, to maintain my relationships.

Again. I just feel like I'm in a mental cage. A web of social and monetary control designed to keep me walking forward from one cage to another. All towards an end that I don't want.

And I keep coming back to how much easier it'd be to just put a gun to my temple. And have to keep stopping myself from thinking about stealing my roommates gun, or applying for my own.

I'm sorry if I'm wasting yalls time. But I keep thinking about killing myself to end all this shit but I'm too scared to do anything now, I'm just afraid one day I'll stop being scared. What the hell is wrong with me. Some girl broke up with me in high school, 3 yrs ago, and I never learned how to move on. She was really mean about it but I just have no idea what to think. I'm always scared of social things, and I need to find some way to deal with this. I thought I let her go but I met a girl that reminds me of her on a trip over spring break and I don't know what the fuck to do. All the feelings came back. I tried to ignore all these feelings for a while but now I'm drinking in the hopes of passing out.


I know I shouldn't drink like this but I don't know how to deal with this stuff. I always hide my feelings from everyone. If I'm happy I don't mind showing it but if I'm sad then I hide it by being mad at people or things around me. I like this girl I met but she has a boyfriend! I know I shouldn't bother her but I like her. She probably hates me.


I am terrible at talking to girls. I just feel like I should be alone forever so I won't do anything wrong to anyone. Please help me. I'm drunk now but tomorrow I'll probably feel just as sad or angry when I wake up. What do I do? I have no where to turn. I've fucked my life up miserably.


Drunken Edit: both sides of my family are alcoholic, either currently or formerly. I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time but I'm more honest when I'm drunk. I always hide my feelings unless I'm drunk. I feel like I should do something different. I'm the first person in my family to go to college in 20 yrs but I'm failing any classes but my German ones.

"I don’t want to live but I don’t want to kill myselfHi guys,

Long time reddit lurker, first time ever posting. 

I’ve been having a lot of difficulties for the past 3 or 4 years. I’ve been to the doctor, I’m starting therapy, im on the antidepressants, I’m ticking all the boxes I’m supposed to. But the people closest to me are struggling to understand what I’m feeling so I thought reaching out might help me put it into words better.

I don’t want to exist anymore. As an entity I feel like I want the opportunity to completely disappear from the planet and cease to be. To not be involved at all with life and just exist in this silent, quiet place where there is nothing. But at the same time, when I think of suicide, it feels almost over the top for my situation. I have no right or reason to feel how I do and that drives me crazy. I have everything going for me but I really just want to disappear.

Recently my thoughts have been erring more on the negative suicide related side. But when I really ask myself, suicide is not what I want. How do I convey to my family and my girlfriend that I understand suicide isn’t the answer and that I just want a break from literally everything? I love them all so much and the idea of leaving them feeling like they’ve failed me kills me so much inside. But at the same time every day I wake up feeling like “I’m not made this” like everything is just too much for my brain. It’s just too much.

I feel like a shit. I have no good reasons for feeling this way. I “should” be really grateful and happy but I’m just not. And it almost feels privileged to have this feeling as if I was really struggling I’d have more important shit to think about and I hate that.

I’m sorry to be going on and on, I don’t know what I expect from this. I just want to hear from people what options I have. I do t think I actually want to die. But currently that’s the only thing I can see that offers respite from how I feel. It’s like a dark fucking void with no edge and when you start falling there’s nothing to stop you. I’m
Hurting all the people I love and I just want to make it stop.

Please if anyone has been really struggling and made it through tell me what helped. I want to make the people I love happy again. I want to feel like me. 

I’m so sorry this is such an unbelievable essay of text. I just don’t know how to convey what I’m testing to say properly.

TLDR; I don’t want to exist but I don’t want to leave my loved ones with the memory that I killed myself, help me. Please.

Thank you internet

"Casual discrimination may be a good thing 
Of course all the BLM and LGBTQ movements are valid and whatnot.

Things like “bro are you gay or what???” May be beneficial. It helps build up tolerance and people who be less touchy and whatnot. It can also form some sort of a collective mindset as people are comfortable with joking about one’s race/religion/sexuality. This may lessen the impact of actual slurs. It also help drive away racist movements and whatnot since it is a harsh love sort of acceptance towards a community. Obviously there must be a mutual consent and understanding so that people who are conscious about their differences don’t get hurt or take it as a personal attack. I’m thinking of this solution being somewhat similar to how people make dark jokes about suicide and depression/anxiety to help feel better or have a laugh about it. For example, my friends and I often laugh about how asians are supposed to be smart but really we are both really dumb WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENCE CUZ APPARENTLY GOD CREATED THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND NOW IM GRADED ON IT. WHAT THE FUCK MAN.

Obviously slurs such as the n-words or f*got should be of the table especially in this very tense global situation(when it comes to gay rights and racial equality) and should only be used by the respective communities if they want to “take back” the slur or show that they are not affected by it anymore.

"Don’t feel sorry feel happy for meI’m going to do it on January  1st 2020. My decision is final and here’s why:

1. I can’t find my place in society. I’m lost. I don’t know what I should do in the future and all the people I trust don’t respect me. Except for one person but I can only FaceTime him because I moved to a different country. I have plans for the future but they are just impossible to fulfill and knowing that I lose all motivation to live.

2.I’m a bad person. Maybe even a psychopath. I don’t care about anybody except my dog and me. When I look in the mirror all I see is a depressed loser who doesn’t want to bring anything good to the world. I make kids mad and cry for my entertainment. I don’t care about people anymore. I don’t trust them. One moment they are your friend, the other they bring you down so bad that you stand with a knife in front of a mirror wanting to cut your wrists and imagining how nice it would be in eternal darkness. 
I smoke. I’m a huge disappointment to my parents. I’m bad at school I had to repeat the year twice and failed twice. My parents invested high amounts of money for education and I failed them.  I make the teachers mad to the point that they drop my grade from a B+ to a F.

3.My philosophy is fucked up. 
Why are people so obsessed with bad stuff. Drugs, Crime etc. If that’s what they like why not give it to them. Well they alway talk about famous killers and how they shoplifted something or got into a fight with somebody. Nobody talks about charity or doing good in the world. Well so I thought I kill myself with a message. I don’t know what I’m going to do but it will be something very public. I’m not going to hurt someone physically.

"I have a homewrecker rep and it seriously sucks Last year I became really good friends with this one girl who had a bf. Me and her were such good friends to the point that people thought she was cheating on her bf with me and spread rumors about it. Then when they broke up (due to already existing issues) some people blamed it on me trying to sabotage their relationship. It didn’t help that I actually did used to like her but since then she was more like a sister to me (don’t take that the wrong way lol). Now I’m in a kinda new friend group and there’s this one girl who got close to me too. She’s got a bf as well. My friends and I realized this is looking like a repeat of last year, this girl has gotten way too close and comfortable with me and it’s scary because this time I don’t know her bf. Last time i was best friends with the girls bf so he knew he didn’t have to worry. So after last year people think of me as some homewrecker and i don’t even try to do these things. And now I gotta try and distance from the new girl so i don’t worsen the rep even more. I don’t mean to sound arrogant saying this I’m sorry, but I don’t know wtf it is that attracts these girls to me (as best friends) to get close and comfy with me.

"Saving a loved one from committing suicide.Thank you for clicking on this post. As many of you here are already aware of, this is an immensely difficult thing to discuss, especially since it's concerning someone I hold incredibly dear to my heart. I have nowhere else to go, and any attempts to seriously talk about this with anyone have been feeble. With that being said, if you can't handle such subjects, I wouldn't want to get any of you involved with this story. Nevertheless, for those who do plan on reading the entirety of it, I am eternally grateful for even giving it a listen.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year now. Many of you will interpret one year as a rather short amount of time to call someone your ""loved one"", especially in same sentence as the term ""suicide"", but it is indeed the sad reality of where the road has taken us/him. I will try not to drown all of you into the tragedy of our love story, but after many hopeless weeks in the fear of the mentioned act, thinking about what went wrong and how to prevent it all, I have decided to come here and share this story, hoping to get any sort of feedback on how to handle the situation, especially if you, by yourself, have gone through/heard of similar experiences.

To keep it all as short as I can - the two of us have been inseparable for the entire duration of our romance. Despite having far too many flaws, he is everything that I have ever wanted in life. Even after countless of fights and arguments, the feelings would always hold us together through the dark of the night. Whenever we hit a bad spot, there was always a reason to keep on going, but he.. he has always had a curse directly tied to him.. a long battle with alcoholism and severe depression, as well as uncontrollable trust issues that lead him into lying about nearly everything going on in his private life, and with that, naturally hurting our relationship as well.. and he.. he'd always tell me that I helped him grow out of it, that he is not ""*that*"" person anymore, and I believed him - maybe he just put up too good of an act, or maybe he REALLY was over it, until the recent event triggered it, with that event being the return of his mother from prison.. And his mother, let's just say she earned her spot there for a reason. However, for the said reasons, the two of us have gotten to a point where we hold little to no trust in each other. He has a massive history with ""*fucking up*"" (the worst kind, which I won't get into due to even harsher reality of our relationship), and recently, after it's been all brought to light and certain *difficulties* presented themselves, he has completely changed. He can't tell me anything, he feels like he betrayed me far too greatly for us to ever recover and claims that there is no way for him to get over such events and threatens to end it all by the end of this month. I cry my soul out trying to convince him that there ***is*** a future for him, that dying isn't the solution to anything and that there is possibly a spot for us to remain together through any stinking obstacle.. but he won't listen. He stopped caring. He just can't handle the thought of staying in life, knowing that he ""fucked up"" far too much, with me, with his family, with his friends, with everyone. I called the suicide prevention line and they told me to give them the details, what kind of words to use to him, and they even offered to come (which I initially accepted), but.. he told me that he would jump out of the window (from the 6th floor) if I do so.

I don't know what to do. I'm emotionally and physically petrified. It hurts beyond words to feel so powerless. Nothing I do feels sufficient, his family doesn't show any sign of caring about what happens to him (as I said previously, he screwed up his relationships with most of them), his friends don't even know what's going on.. and I.. I just can't believe that what was so pure and perfect has lead into one of us wishing death upon themselves. And he won't stop. I know it. I can feel it. I'm ready to get police involved, I'm ready to go to any length to pull him out of this.. but he threatened that he will end it all in case I do.",,Depressed

"Idk if I'm in love Hi, I've found this sub about 5 minutes ago and scrolling the various topic, seems like is the right place to solve my doubts.

I start saying that English is not my first language, so I probably did some mistakes.

I don't understand if I'm in love with my best friend and if she is interested in me.
We know each other since primary school and this year we finished high school. For some reasons we end up going to the same university.
We get along very well, we have no problem sleeping in the same bed, stay close, passing entire afternoon together, etc... things that two best friends do.

The problems started this summer, me and her were bored because we were on holiday with our parents and we started chatting and calling at the phone almost every day. When we met I started creating occasion to be alone with her but my friends are stupid and didn't leave me alone. Finally, some days ago I helped her for the an exam but I came out from her house more confused than before.

During past years I had my experiences and I know how does it fell being in love but this time I'm not sure if it's the same feeling.
Another thing that confuses me are our (female) friends. They sometimes started saying why we two don't start dating and they look at me as I should understand something. (This is my thought, I'm not sure)
She is quite shy, especially with guys, so she probably wouldn't do the first move, but I'm afraid to do it beacuse I don't really know what I feel and I've always considered her more like a little sister (despite she is older than me).
 
Hope you guys can give me some good advices.
Thanks in advance.",,Anxious

"I can't connectDepression is something you can’t escape from, many people have compared it to drowning but that’s not quite right. If you drown you’re almost certain to die, however with depressions its almost as if you’re floating in limbo, not quite dead, not quite alive, but still suffering all the pain of drowning. With the drowning comes the numb, dull senses. Everything around you just seems so pointless, everything so black and white, all atmospheres are bland. Normal people laugh, cry, smile, feel anxious, feel guilt, feel passion, I however am broken, I don’t remember what It’s like to feel anything other than this fleeting pain, this never ending suffering, the constant grasping for air, the all too familiar depths of this darkness that's surrounding me. I might just be overthinking things, but that’s how I am now. I over analyze absolutely everything, every little detail of what I could have done differently, how things could have been if i chose to do something else, how I could be if i had made better choices. I’m constantly reminded by those around me what it would be like if I were normal, to love someone, to be loved, to feel proper sadness, to overcome that sadness, normal emotions.


I’m so broken beyond repair, I’ve tried reaching out to people but it always seems to drive them away, but that's the thing with drowning, you’re suffering so much, gasping for air, reaching for anything around to to grab on to. So I understand that people wouldn’t want to be pulled under with me, I wouldn’t wish anyone to feel the way I feel, although I’m sure there are plenty of people who do. Those who voluntarily tried to help me ended up getting caught in my pain, getting dragged under the water, as soon as they had a glimpse at what I was feeling they swam off, unable and unwilling to feel like that any longer and yet again, I’m left here by myself, slowly sinking further into the depths.


A “friend” of mine said to me recently ‘you know what you suffered from?
mauerbauertraurigkeit.’
Now I had no idea what this was at the time, I’m still not sure if it’s even a real word, but regardless it describes somewhat how I’ve become as of late.
The word is of german origins, 
“n. the inexplicable urge to push people away, even close friends who you really like—as if all your social tastebuds suddenly went numb, leaving you unable to distinguish cheap politeness from the taste of genuine affection, unable to recognize its rich and ambiguous flavors, its long and delicate maturation, or the simple fact that each tasting is double-blind.”


Now this struck close to home, I’ve been doing this for years. Getting close to people but eventually pushing them away when they got too deep, when they got behind the farce I put up around others. I want to spare people from feeling how I feel, even dealing with me in most cases.


I think to myself quite often, the less people I have around me the better, I’m like a grenade just waiting to go off, the less damage the better. It’s inevitable that I’ll blow one day, that much I’m certain of. Until then I’ve always minimized the amount of people I’m close with. Never really getting too close with anyone that they start to pry. But with this comes inescapable loneliness, the kind that swallows you whole, nights spent staring at the ceiling or walls. I’ve spent countless nights just sitting with my back against the wall, nails digging into my legs, shaking, so broken and so lonely, but i guess I brought that on myself. You reap what you sow.


When people talk about preventing depression and suicide, they talk about loved ones, they tell you about all the people who will love and miss you. This isn’t reassuring in the slightest, they’re guilt tripping me into not harming myself. I understand that people have emotional attachment to me, but my fundamental right as a human to do as I wish with my own body as long as I do no harm to others trumps it. Not only are they adding guilt to the sea of problems I have, they blackmail me into not harming myself. “If you hurt yourself, so will I”.
But it’s not so easy to stop it, I have blackouts, periods where everything just fades out and I go numb, only realizing what I’m doing when It’s too late. Now they’ve added another problem to my sea of problems, swirling around like a storm in my mind, thrashing about inside my head until something breaks.


Now I know it’s not anyone else fault but my own that I’m in this situation. I could have gone for help when I needed it most, yet I sat in my subdued mindset and let everything build up until the point I’m at now, the point of no return. Going back on my previous statement of “I’m broken beyond repair”. There’s no fixing what I am now, I’ve tried medication, counselling, relying on friends, taking every kind of drugs there are, and drinking myself to a near death state, passing out every time I do so. The only two of those things that worked were the most damaging for myself and those around me, drinking and drugs. For almost three years I was addicted to synthetic cannabis and every other kind of mind numbing drugs I could get my hands on, pairing it with a bottle of vodka. It all numbed what I was feeling even if it was only for a short time, it was better than feeling the way I am now, even if it meant destroying my body and mind in the process. However my mind was probably too far gone to begin with.


I’m not really sure why I’m writing this, I’m not sure if anyone will ever see it, it feels weird, almost like writing my last testament of what really went on in my mind, a written version of my “true self”.


My friends and family would not look at me the same if they knew what went on in my mind. the never ending thoughts of killing myself, but it’s not as simple as you think It is. It’s not just “I want to die” its more elaborate than that. When I look at things, I think to myself, “If i jump from there, I wonder if it would kill me”, “I wonder if that ceiling fan could hold my weight”, “what if i accidentally cut my neck while shaving”, “what If i don’t move from in front of this car”, “how many of these pills would I need to take, should i drink the rest of the bottle as well”. My mind is beyond tainted, this is why I’m broke beyond repair.


I haven’t been sleeping right for years now, I hear my parents get up each morning when I’ve yet to sleep. I can go days without sleep, well, I wouldn’t call it “going without” as it’s involuntary. But who knows, maybe everyone has these thoughts I’m having, maybe everyone thinks the same way I do. I guess I’ll never find out, after all, I’m just a broken beyond repair teenager who’s waiting to explode, a time bomb that's going to take out everything within close proximity, devastating all those who made the mistake of getting close to me.

"I don't know what to do or how to handle this honestly. So I was talking to this girl for like 2 months(I come off as very cool and collected but I get really insecure when faced with trying to advance with a girl) and I really liked her.

she was like, perfectly my type. her personality is very similar to mine except she knows how to process emotion, shes slightly less stupid and has 3x the amount of common sense, and she's a hugger (Touch starvation isn't cool) lmao. Personally, I'm not very picky when it comes to their body but this girl has what I would consider my ideal body type. shes 5'3(As we all know at this point short girls are elite), and has a fit build(Idk how else to explain it) 

We would text for hours every day, and we FaceTimed a few times. Our parents are also very similar and she said in the past she has been grounded randomly and recently she just stopped responding to my texts. Honestly idk if she just ghosted me or if she got grounded because she doesn't seem like the kind of person to just ghost somebody. 

That was like 3 weeks ago (I know what you are going to say ""Just get over her"" yeah I probably should) but I'm still just waiting to get a text from her. She was one of the only people who I felt comfortable talking to about my problems. 

The fun part is I have what most would call mommy issues which is pretty much because of a lack of a good maternal figure in my life. So I get very attached very fast, and I crave positive attention from women (She was a very positive person and I get very paranoid and insecure sometimes so ill be convinced I'm a bad person or something and she'd help me come out of the intrusive thoughts and paranoia, she would say she liked helping me through things like that and whenever I would thank her or apologize for tweaking out and her helping me she would always tell me not to apologize and that there was no need to thank her. so I could assume I wasn't just draining her because of all that but who knows).

 I usually force myself to not get attached to anyone out of fear of being hurt but I felt like this girl was someone I could seriously go for. So I let myself get closer to her than I really ever let myself get with anyone else and now she's just kinda was gone. It really sucks because I was actually thinking about telling her that I liked her, which is something I NEVER do.

Idk some advice or something would be nice but it is what it is.

In the country I live you can’t get bank account if you’re underage without adult permission, you can’t order stuff online, you can’t work legally, etc.  And I’m too dependent on my parents and it makes me sick. I have no idea how to become more independent when I’ll be 18.  Without work experience… It looks like everything will be the same: they will do my laundry for me, tell me what to do, drive me to malls, talk with teachers for me, cook meals, etc. And  about intimacy. I never had a boyfriend, was never ask out, never kissed someone to the lips, never been hugged, was never invited to the party or friends house, never had sex. When a guy approaches me I just don’t know how to behave. I just don’t have the flirting skills. I feel like I’m always looking for someone to do things for me. I missed all those years when you gain social experience, etc., because I was sitting at home and reading books, gaining knowledge. I had terrible depression last year.. When the time came to choose between friends and higher position in school, I chose the better position. I had perfect grades, but at that time I lost all of my friends, because I worked more. When I realized how alone I was, I just worked harder, keeping myself busy to forget about it. I gained knowledge, but everyone around was turning away from me, I even sat alone all the time at school, when everyone sat in pairs, no one wanted to work in group/pairs with me. I had a few opportunities to stop the loneliness, but I rejected everyone who tried to get closer to me. And when I met someone who had normal social life and better knowledge/grades/skills than me…I lost motivation and will to live. No matter how hard I tried, someone was better than me. I reached the bottom. I was bullied a lot, everyone made fun of me . I didn’t know who I was anymore, everything seemed pointless. No matter how much I tried to gain friends back, no one wanted me, even my own family. I started to believe that I’m stupid and I accepted it. But after 4-5 years of trying.. I wanted to gain my knowledge back again. I keep trying to become that motivated, selfish, but very hard working and intelligent person I was, but it’s not coming back. Now I’m left without friends and “brain”. Can’t find my place in this world. I lost the hope. I have depression, social anxiety, I’m afraid to go outside and make interaction with other people because I know that I’ll be rejected and misunderstood.

I'm the one always fucking up every good thing I've ever had. And then I have to wake up and deal with the piece of shit body. Every morning I'm forced to look at it and I hate it. I can't stand it. But I know I can't change it, even if I were to transition, I would never pass. I'm already 6'3 and have massive fucking limbs and broad shoulders. My facial features are way too masculine and amount of hormones is going to change the fact that I was born a guy. That I'll never be a real woman. That even if I were to transition, I'd have to live a life of fear just because I'm black and trans. I feel like I lose either way, that either way I go, I still end up miserable. I'll never be someones wife or mother, I'll forever be this gigantic freak who wishes they were a woman. I wish that I could be a normal teenage girl for just one day, but I can't and no amount of wishing to an unforgiving god is going to make that happen. I'll forever be mocked and ridiculed, called slurs, and quite possibly assaulted or even murdered. It doesn't help that my grandparents hate trans people, and my parents used to make fun of them. I fucking hate this rural fucking state, I hate everything about it. It won't matter for to much longer though, I'm going to kill myself on Friday. I plan to take a bunch pills in the middle of the night and go to sleep. I'm so done with everything, I just want my life to be over.",,Depressed
"I've tried killing myself twice and I'm getting close to number three. Third times the charm right?I don't know how these work so I'm just going to type what comes to mind.

I just turned 20 this month. I have a daughter who is 9 months old this month. Her mom and I had a great relationship, and she was my best friend. I moved to college when I was 18, and it was the hardest time of my life. I had this amazing girl back home whom I would only on the weekends if that, and I just was not prepared for the shit-storm that is college work.

Up until my junior year of high school, I was a straight A student, only then dipping to A's and B's (maybe a C here and there). I got a 30 on my ACT, which got me into a pretty damn good school. The school I had always imagined I'd go to. However, when I went to college, I was almost immediately put on academic probation. This was a total shock for me even I was taking some hard classes (physics, chemistry, calculus, and a couple others I don't remember). I ended up dropping physics for fear of failure (I was entirely lost in the class even after going to office hours and such). I also ended up dropping calculus and taking pre-calc after a few weeks. Chemistry was hard, but I thought I had it under control. I ended up so behind on my work that I failed the course. I don't even know what my final grade was even though I studied my ass off for it (somewhere around 16 hours a day).

Well, right around that time I find out my girlfriend is pregnant. Honestly I thought she was the one, and I was determined to be there for her. That, and the fact that I was on academic probation, lead me to make the decision to drop out and go to community college back home. That wasn't such a big deal for me because I had friends there, and the plan was to transfer to an equally good local private school.

I needed a job though, so I applied everywhere and finally got a job at Walgreens. I have bad social anxiety and social skills so this was pretty terrifying for me. I hated every minute working at that job, although I made some cool friends I never thought I'd be friends with. During this time, I was going with my girlfriend to her doctor's appointments, and spending time with her. The thing is, my parents didn't know she was pregnant. I was terrified to tell them because they had specifically told me that if I got her pregnant they would stop paying for school, they would take away my car, and they would kick me out of the house (they are devout catholics). It took me 4 months to work up the courage to tell them. Luckily my girlfriend wasn't showing too bad. They actually ended up taking it better than I thought. They cried a lot, and my mom was kind of depressed for a month maybe more, but they didn't do any of the things they threatened me with.

I want to take a break from the story to apologize if this story is all over the place.

Anyway I thought my life was ok for a while, although I was nervous that I was going to be a dad. Now, with all of this stuff going on (school, a job I hated, and soon to be a dad), I was started to get down on life. I didn't like how things were going for me, and I started to bury myself in something I enjoyed during my free time (video games). Well stupid teenage me didn't realize the damage I was doing to my relationship. I was blocking everything else out. I bought a ps4 and basically every new game as they came out. I even was bribed with an xbox one and a pair of astro a50 headphones, because we couldn't agree on a baby name. Terrible I know. I would come home every day super stressed out, and just play video games until I was so tired I was going to pass out. I spent probably close to $2000 on video games and video game things in about 9 months.

Although I was unwittingly hurting my relationship, I still loved my girlfriend. After all, we were having a kid together. When our daughter was born, I moved in with my girlfriend and her mom. This made it even easier for me to just come home and do nothing all night because I didn't have my parents watching over me. Well that only lasted about 3 months. During those 3 months, I could feel my girlfriend losing interest, but I didn't see it as my fault. I think I also felt that since we had just had a baby together I was ""safe"". Well pretty soon, my girlfriend and I were arguing every day, and I was sure she was keeping something from me. I accused her of cheating on me. Something just wasn't right. I even caught her snapchatting some guy a hell of a lot who she claimed she had known for years and who had just recently messaged her randomly. We broke up 3 months after our daughter was born because of a stupid argument over nothing. I immediately regretted it, called her (maybe 15-30 minutes after we broke up), and apologized profusely. Well somehow in those 15-30 minutes she made up her mind that we were done. Just like that.

Well, I was in love with her and couldn't just let her go like that so I worked my ass off to get her back, but she wasn't having it. Fast forward a couple months and she randomly started acting... ""cute"" towards me. We started hanging out again, and things were really looking up. One thing I wasn't comfortable with though, was that she was still texting this guy, and wouldn't let me know what it was about, claiming they just talked about me and he gave her advice or something. Well, a month later I felt like we could start dating again, but I couldn't ask her out unless she stopped talking to this guy. She said she would and that was a step. However, the very next day I caught her texting him that they could skype later that day.

Well that pissed me off, so I demanded to know what stuff they talked about if we were going to date again. She refused over and over, and finally said ok if you meet me at my house I will tell you. So i agree, and when I get there it turns out she had called her mom home, because she wasn't planning on telling me and knew I would be mad. Well I was, and I said our relationship can't work without trust. After plenty of arguing she finally agreed to show me.

She gave me her phone, and I started to scroll to the top of the messages. She asked what I was doing, and I said I wanted to start from the beginning, and she freaked out and demanded her phone back. It was right then I scrolled past the word ""sex"". She took her phone back and we argued and I asked what that was about, and she said he asked her for sex but she denied it. Then after some arguing I look at her phone some more and I see that she texted him ""I love you too (heart eyed emoji)"". Well that did it for me. I was absolutely furious. I yelled at her and demanded the truth. After plenty of arguing I got out of her that she had cheated on me with him but it was just a kiss, and that he leaned in and she didn't know how to stop it. Well that is a pretty poor excuse if you ask me. I asked for his phone number so I could yell at him because I was so mad I didn't know what else to do. I looked down at my phone and wow! I got a facebook message from him. Something about her cheating on me and having sex. Oh and the fact that they had met on a dating website. I asked her about the sex, and she denied it over and over. I wasn't letting up though. Finally I got it out of her that they did have sex.

Cue the most depressed I'd been in my life. My life was spiraling out of control. I quit my job just like that. 2 weeks later, I decided I wanted to kill myself. I took a belt and put it around my neck. My problem was that I told my ex, who called my parents. They made me see a doctor, who admitted me to a mental hospital. I had no contact with anyone except for my parents outside of the hospital. Having had a lot of time to self reflect, I decided I wanted to call my ex. I also really just wanted to hear my daughter's voice. We talked for a few days on the phone, and then I asked her to come visit me in the hospital.

She had told me before that she was sorry for everything she had done, and how she never wanted it to happen. I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. I loved her still. We decided we should work on things, but I was still hurting from everything that had happened, and we still argued. The first week out of the hospital was great though. However, after that first week, she told me we should just work on ourselves for a while. I didn't want to do that, but I reluctantly agreed.

Well, my depression didn't get any better after that. I still had major trust issues with her, but I desperately wanted things to work out. I especially want my daughter to grow up with both of her parents together. My depression got worse and worse and I tried killing myself again. I just walked out into a blizzard one night, and after some walking, I tried to cut my throat and my wrists with whatever I could find (a stick). The cop's found me and took me to the hospital.

That kind of brings us to where we are today. She has been telling me she is working on herself for a few months now. I keep asking her if we can try to work on things together but she keeps giving me shitty answers, or telling me yes, and then always blowing me off or whatever. Well, turns out she's being seeing ANOTHER person. So she is still lying to me, after everything we've been through. And I honestly thought she wanted to work on herself and then we were going to give us another shot. She specifically told me she didn't want a relationship with anyone right now. Yet she met this guy on tinder or something I don't fucking know.

I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I dropped out of school the second time I tried killing myself. I have no interest in ANYTHING anymore. I shouldn't say anything, I would like to go back to school and do something in the medical marijuana industry but I'm ashamed to admit that to anyone because my family is very anti-marijuana.

The worst thing about this whole thing is that I still love my ex. I've been begging me to give me a shot even after I found out she's been seeing this other guy. It's stupid I know. I just don't understand how someone can go from the nicest and most fun person I've ever met, to a lying, manipulative, bitch. I don't think it's fair that I am in so much pain, and she just doesn't care. She is the one doing wrong, so why am I being punished?

I am so close to losing it for good guys. I've got a bottle of prescription meds next to me that I keep thinking of downing. I just want the pain to end.

TL;DR: Everything I've written is the simplified version. There is a lot more to the story and a lot of things causing me pain.

Edit: Sorry if this sounds really childish or something. I guess at 20 I am still a child. I do, however, know that this is the worst emotional pain I've ever been in. I am stuck in a rut and I don't see any escape right now. I guess that is the depression clouding my judgement.",,Depressed

"cryinghi i’m new but i’ve been looking at that “how to die without pain” thread for a few years now and never felt more belonged, so i decided to join some reddit communities related to suicide or depression. long story “short”, i’m still alive because: 

1. i feel guilty for having so many privileges (a lot of freedom in the way i can study what i want, managed to get away from an abusive father that almost killed me a few times in my childhood, i may not be a millionaire but i’m definitely not poor, i’m not be white but i’m still a pale asian so i don’t get much discrimination, etc) yet i am still full of frustration and pain, and i still want to die. it’s like i’m the most unappreciative being and it’s eating me up inside. “whY aRe yOU sO uNhAPpy?” “bE grATeFuL ya spOiLt bRaT”

2. my two overdose attempts (amitriptyline and thylenol) both ended up in failure. now i have a gag reflex and can’t swallow a whole lotta pills in one go. unfortunately i am a pussy and don’t dare to die in pain

3. i don’t look depressed. i can get up, go to the bathroom, and go to school (most of the time) like a lifeless robot so...people think i’m fine/overdramatic and queue toxic positivity. people just say go to therapy etc and the 5 times i’ve gone they just said i don’t put in the effort. why worth trying again and having hope for the nth time. i’m already worrying about how to function and get a job in the future with a degree that will basically get me nowhere yet i chose it not even because i want to pursue in it, but because i hate or am not intelligent enough for anything else. it was a last resort.

I still struggled a lot with thoughts of wanting to die, but I don't know. I had a reason to keep going - my boyfriend.

Now everything is falling apart again and I'm not sure where to go from here. I might have ruined my relationship of 8 years, I lost my best friend to suicide last year and I'm still not over it, and I have nowhere to move to, no family that can take me in if my boyfriend decides to leave me.

"I can't make it through thisIf not for COVID, I know it would all be fine. As difficult as things were, I had a way out. Every time I got knocked down I got up and started trying again. But I'm stuck living in a house in which I was essentially a prisoner until I was in my late twenties. Waking up and interacting with the people here saps my will to live. I had everything lined up to get away in March before the lockdown.

This is just too much for me. I cannot do anything here, I can't concentrate, I can't think clearly. I can't meet new people or make connections on the internet, because being here so thoroughly warps my perceptions and my way of communicating with people.

The people I'm living with are especially vulnerable to COVID, so I've had very little contact with the outside world since mid February. I'm reverting to the feelings and reactions that I developed in order to survive the worst of my isolation and abuse. 

I keep trying but nothing changes. I have no one waiting for me on the other side of this. I don't have happy memories with people to lean on and buoy me through this time. I think I'm ready to die. At this point, I'm not sure that this is worth keeping up for anyone else, or if there is any good reason to prevent whatever pain they might experience from my passing.

"Sorry to bother you guys but I need help/advice I have my end-of-year exams and assignments in a couple weeks (about 10). My parents say they expect just as good marks this year, despite COVID delaying my normal study by a few weeks. I have still studied for 5 weeks but am really worried about not doing as well as I would normally bc its still less than normal and I only get about 75% on average. I know it's not the end of the world if I fail them but I go to a government selective high school and my family and teachers (and sort of myself) have really high expectations of me.

I'm also feeling a lot more stressed and anxious than normal, I haven't been cheerful or felt happy since I started preparing for the tests and I just am having a really hard time staying positive this term. I can't talk to my family about this bc they get offended if I say I don't feel good about this and they think I'm just being selfish. Am I just overreacting? I need some advice on how to stay positive and motivated during this time, or exam advice.

Really, I'll appreciate any replies bc that lets me know people care enough to talk.

Sry to be such a whiner, I just wanted to pour out my feelings and talk to other teenagers without feeling embarrassed like I do irl sometimes.

But that joke escalated, after summer I had started attending to the other teacher explanations and me and the girl weren't attending together, but the joke continued as we kept contact. And we started playing along, we started acting like we were together... and the Covid happened. Both the classes and the explanations continued online, and so did the joke. And things were getting serious, before we sent cute messages to each other on the group chat but we started doing it through pms. Though I'd never had dated I had already got played with my feelings by a girl just for her to tell me she had a boyfriend.

"Just looking for someone to understandHi,

Thank you so much for doing what you do. 

I don't want to take up much of your time, since I did decide awhile back that I won't commit suicide.  But not a day goes by that I don't have suicidal thoughts, and I'm having a particularly tough morning and I just need someone to share what I'm going through.

My life and my self is so fucked up at the moment that I can't justify telling any of my family or friends the full extent of what I'm going through. I don't want to worry or stress them out further than they are about me.

Basically, I went completely fucking crazy for 7 months right as &amp; after moving states and trying to buy a house while out of state and trying to help my then fiance run his business while being completely childish and selfish and having a completely negative fucked up mental state.

I cheated on my fiance multiple times. Then came to my senses, realized a lot of things. Admitted that I needed therapy and started going. Started realizing the vast extent of how fucked up I've been inside. I'm about 99.99% sure I have a split personality(-ies) or some kind of dissociative disorder and now the ""real me"" is dealing with a reality where I cheated on (in my opinion) the greatest man there is, and he doesn't know if he wants to be with me - the only chance is if I become someone completely healthy and different, someone who would NEVER do anything anywhere near what I did.

And we're living together, in massive credit card debt and the business is both overloaded with work while at the same time if we don't get a client or two, we run completely out of money in a few weeks.

This morning, my dog who recently attacked my neighbor's dog, again went over...I didn't see...I looked away for maybe 15-20 seconds and I didn't hear a ruckus. I looked up and saw my neighbor carrying her dog and my dog was at the edge of the road. A week after I had apologized profusely and said it would never happen again. 

My ex fiance is fucking livid with me.

It crushed me. Both that and the fear from the possibility of my neighbor calling and taking my dog away.

There's more, but I don't want to take up any more of your time or my time right now. 

I guess I'm just wondering if I could have like a cyber hug or something..? I'm having a hard time and I'm so tired from myself and the parts of my life that are insanely hard and from struggling against the suicidal thoughts and working so fucking hard to get myself to a positive mindset constantly.


Thank you so much for listening. Seriously. You fucking rock.

"I messed up big time Ok context: my GFs dad said if were ever hanging out there has to be adult supervision.

That's fair and I get why that is and every other time we have there has been 

So today I decide ""eh parents arent home who cares it's not like anyone would find out"" 

I explain this to my GF she agrees we go to my house and watch JoJos Bizarre Adventure for a bit.

We did not do anything NSFW because we aren't stupid.

The one day.
The one day my GFs dad texts my parents to ask if they're home.

I walk her home and her mom pokes her head out the door and says her dad wants to talk to us for a second

And I immediately started to panic in my head.

My thought process was as follows but I took the liberty of making it a little more SFW:

""FrickFrickFrick did he find out? FrickFrickFrick no. Theres no way he could have all she asked her mom was if she could come over she didnt specify anything else FrickFrickFrickFrickFrick""

Got inside and conversation went as follows (*means I was just thinking it*

GF'S dad: okay Levi if your parents arent home Julia cant come over 

*oh my good freakin god*
Me: oh ok I'm sorry

GFs dad: I want you to come over here more often 
(Normally we hang out at my house)

Me: oh alright will do

GFs dad: yeah next time you guys are out walking (that's how we usually start hanging out we just go for a walk together cause we live close by) just come back here

Me: ok will do

I should specify he wasn't yelling or being harsh it was really just a step below passive aggressive but I have never been more mortified 

And like I said we weren't doing anything NSFW but theres no way he could know that

The worst part about this is I'm worried my GF got in trouble for my stupid decision.

TL,DR I hung out with my GF when my parents weren't home (nothing NSFW was done) and her dad and I had an awkward conversation 

Obviously I'll be going over there for a while and being as respectful as possible and maybe I'll give an update in a while to see if this gets less awkward.

I know that I can get better, but I have no energy to do so and the loneliness is the only feeling I really have left at this point. I don't want to disappoint anyone in my life even though all I feel like I do is fuck up and hurt people or ruin things anyway. I feel so selfish but I don't want to live anymore. I've laughed maybe once in the past week and smiled only out of politeness when I accidentally make eye contact with people. I don't think that anyone around me other than my parents would even care if I died within a few days anyway. I'm sure they could all get on with their lives. I just hope and pray that I am hit by a truck or killed by a random murderer every day, because I just want everything to be over at this point. I don't want to burden any of my few friends or limited family with all this information, my parents are already worried enough about me and while they do everything they can to support me, nothing really helps or works anymore.

back in 5th grade, there was a 4th grade girl, (let's call her Rosa) who had just entered my class, which was for grade 4, 5, and 6 students. she was cute, and because of that, i immediately had a crush on her. i spent most of grade 5 just trying to get up the nerve to talk to her, which was very unsuccessful most of the time.

in grade 6, i finally started hanging out with Rosa and i was getting to know about her. at this point, i truly believed i was in love with her (and i actually might have). i didn't want to ruin my friendship with her by telling her how i felt, so i started telling one of my classmates all about it. the guy was also my upstairs neighbor in my apartment building (let's call this guy Ethan).

during grade 6, i had told Ethan lots about how i thought that Rosa was the one who i was meant to be with (which was pretty ridiculous), and a whole bunch of other nonsense like that. i'll get back to the subject of Ethan later on.

by the end of grade 6, i still hadn't told Rosa my feelings. BUT, i was in a summer camp that year, and Rosa was also in it, too. i had planned to give her an unfinished sudoku puzzle as a gift (she started a few months previously, and hadn't finished it), but the paper with the puzzle was ruined on the day i was gonna give it to her. i didn't get the chance to talk to her about it, because it was the last day of the summer camp, so i was pretty screwed.

skip ahead a few months, and now i'm in a new school, in grade 7. i had pretty much no way to contact Falda, so i thought i was not gonna be able to tell her that i liked her (yes, i still had a crush on this same girl). i eventually realized that i could ask Ethan to deliver a letter to Rosa, since he was still in class with her.

so, i wrote a note on a piece of paper that said: ""Dear Rosa, i have been in love with you since grade 5. signed, Exzavier"" (exzavier is my name). i then gave it to Ethan, and asked him to deliver the note to Rosa, and he was unsure about it. i told him that as soon as he could, he should give Rosa the letter, and i checked up everyday after school to see if he had given it to her. one day, however, i realized that i shouldn't let Rosa see the letter, because she could show other people what it said.

after school that day, i asked Ethan to give me the letter back, and he said that he had just given it to her less than an hour beforehand.

it was at that moment i knew, i f\*\*ked up.

a week later, i got a letter from Rosa saying that she told everyone who she knew about that letter. she also said that i had ""the maturity of a spoon"". nowadays, i just avoid talking with her, since anytime i see her at school (she goes to my high school), i have a little panic attack.

Ever since I went into secondary school I have just been feeling like shit and that was almost 4 years ago. I hear the same insults back and forth and for me, it does not get easier,  mainly due to my friends, they insult me, berate me, make fun of me and I feel powerless, they all team up and i feel excluded. They all came out as gay recently and I couldn't of been more proud of them but they make fun of me still. They exclude me from birthday parties, meetups, going out to the town and group chats. they have group chats all about hating me which i always think is a joke but at the back of my mind, I really don't know. They say the same shit to me. It's always:

* You're small
* You're weak
* You look gross
* You are poor
* You are a 'straggot' (whatever tf that means)
* You're a terrorist (I'm brown and Muslim faith)
* Your voice is so high pitched
* You have no facial hair
* You will never find love
* \[Make fun of my last name (Butt). its not even fair, it just handed to them, its pronounced and spelt literally 'Butt'  i hear the same shit they don't have to be creative\]
* You are ugly
* You're so skinny
* Eat something bones
* Remember that time u/Tubiey did \[insert embarrassing or cringy thing from past\]
* You are stinky
* Your teeth are so gross 

I feel like shit, i hate the person i see in the mirror so much. I actively try not to look at mirris cause i hate what i am. I hate my teeth, I hate my braces i hate my glasses i hate my skin colour i hate my faith i hate my height i hate my voice i hate my face i hate my eyes i hate last name.  

I used to be so idgaf-y and I am an extrovert i like starting a conversation with new people to try to make new friends but now when i meet new people i fear they will see all the flaws in me i see. and the reason i feel so much shittier is its somewhat bearable if you are the only one who thinks your shit but to know your closest friends think the same just breaks me.  granted i have not been the best friend either, for the first 2 years i would deny what they say and just insult back but theses last 2 almost im giving up. I just agree with their insults I've made sure to just stop insulting them as it made it worse and its just so fucked.

This is my second main friend group. My first one excluded me berated me and all that jazz but then when they would all go out to do fun shit. they would spam me picture of them having fun. i feel i have no fucking power against them at all i feel like I'm horrible. and even now outside of school i hang out with some of my online friends but a new guy who recently joined that every one likes insults all my skill all my shit so much racist shit i hear every day.

I got drunk on three bottles of wine and hit my mom, got arrested, went to jail, been blacked out drunk ever since despite starting going to AA (need to start anger management too) 
I can’t go back to jail but my charge pretty much guarantees I will, especially since I can’t afford a lawyer. I was in jail for one night before the bail bondsman got me out and it was absolute hell. I’ve been in shitty situations before but this was something different. I will do whatever I can to never go back to that place. My mom won’t talk to me anymore. I got kicked out of her house. I will never be able to join the military which is what I’ve wanted to do my whole life. I won’t be able to get a decent job with my charge, or rent a decent house. My life is fucked from here on out. Honestly I just don’t see the point in going on. I hate the time I live in, everything is completely fucked now a days and what’s the point in fighting my ass off to live a life I hate anyway..?",,Depressed

"i dont know how to deal with my childhood (this will be long but i need to tell someone this. i am tired of keeping it in my head)hi. im 16 and i am feeling suicidal right now (have been for  months). i know i wont do it because it will devastate my mother and i never want to do that to her but i cant deny that i wish i was dead almost everyday. i don't want to kill myself,  i just want to be dead. thinking about death just makes me feel free and happy. i just feel like i'll be happier in heaven and i long to have that feeling. i lived a very traumatic childhood and i feel like i cant forget the bad memories.

 i need a therapist but i am afraid to tell my mother because she wont understand. i also don't want her to blame herself for my depression and this makes me feel guilty. sometimes i feel like i don't 'deserve' to be sad because my mom tried her hardest to provide us with the best life that she could. however, our life was always very hard and miserable no matter how hard she tried to fix it . i once cried and  told my mom that i felt depressed because of everything that happened when i was a child and she started crying as well telling me that she felt guilty and that our life was the best she could have ever give us. also, she kept saying stuff like ""what do you want me to do!?"" and "" i feel more depressed than you"" so i feel like i can't tell how i feel because she makes me feel guilty for being sad. 

since i was younger, money was always an issue. i felt as if money was going to run out and i was always scared of what we would do if that actually happened. so whenever my mom talks about money, i get so nervous and anxious and i just wish i was dead. because my childhood was so stressful (up until last year), i tend to break whenever i encounter a stressful situation. i just cant handle it anymore. i just feel as if my mind is overflowing and is going to explode from stress and anxiety. my childhood was so stressful that i started losing melanin in my skin. so, i ended up with white patches on my body. idk if anyone has this as well.

dont get me wrong, i adore my mum, but she just can't handle my depression because she deals with it as well. so, i never tell her because i fear that it will make her depression worse. i just sometimes pray to god that i die because i feel like im too broken to continue with life. i used to look forward to go to college and continue on with my studies and get a good job and blah blah blah. my parents used to be so proud of but now i feel as if i cant give that to them anymore. i have lost my interest in studying and i feel lost in my dreams. i just feel like i'll never actually have a successful and happy future anyways, so why keep living?

He calls me pretty back. My confidence goes up and I take the next step: I tell him to let me know if he would ever want to hang out.

14 hours pass. I’m afraid he’s ghosting me. But then, he responds: For sure, I’ll let you know. How am I supposed to interpret that? There’s so many meanings and of course I overthink it for hours and hours. But the ball’s in his court now. There’s nothing else I can do. I just decide to drop it and leave it be.

Then, a couple hours later he asks me the hang out this weekend.

My point: it’s so so scary to be vulnerable, especially to people you like. There’s fear of rejection, embarrassment, etc. 

But here’s the thing: if you take that leap two things will happen

1. If they say no, then you don’t have to waste your time anymore. You can move on to better things.

2. If they say yes, then awesome! You have a cool story unfolding in front of you.

I know it’s easy for me to say cause it worked out, but this is the first time in a long time. The same scenario actually occurred over the summer, and the other guy ended up ghosting me. NEVER GIVE UP YOUR TIME WILL COME.

I'm used to life pissing on me with out the courtesy of calling it rain but I think my newest problem may just be the one to get me to say fuck it. Black mold. My apartment had a water leak that wasn't caught until it caused a serious black mold problem. Finding out was actually good because it had unknowingly been the cause of a lot of health problems for me. Landlord says a dehumidifier will fix it... which it obviously doesn't.  The problem is I had nowhere to go. I didn't 't have the savings to move into a new place. I have no family. So I just had to grit my teeth and stay there until I saved up enough to move. The problem is living there fucking hurts.  I can't sleep there for more that 3 hours (but have nowhere else to sleep), in the morning my chest hurts, I have this constant brain fog, get continual headaches and my eyes burn. I'm exhausted.  I saved up enough money to get a new place, it looked nice enough didn't see any problems. I leased ut and turned on the utilities. It was a duplex. I had about half my things moved in before the AC broke. Landlord said he'd send someone to fix it. I had to work and still had the apartment so I didn't see the big deal. 2 days later it's still not fixed. So this is 3 days in, I've barely been there because of work, and the place being in tolerably hot. I finally get a day off and open up the door to the AC unit. roaches. .. everywhere. Peice of shit landlord knew about it and tried to hide it. So the choice was to stay at a place that makes me sick, or a roach infested hotbox.... I've chosen to stay in the apartment.  Today I took a vacation day from work to move my shit out of the duplex. I'll be able to afford another place in a few weeks, but I'm just so fucking tired, and just want to not feel like shit anymore. Honestly just ending it now seems like a better idea then just struggling to keep going. I've been telling myself it will get better for years. it never gets better.

"My Contribution to HumanityJust hear me out please


Life on earth has been around for (at least) 3.9 billion years. Let that sink in. 

Every single individual in my ancestral lineage has managed to reproduce and pass on genetic information to their progeny, allowing each generation to be more suitable than the last. Against all odds, each of my ancestors—no matter their form of life—has done their single, most basic, fundamental duty: procreate. 

But then there is me, the terminus.

I will be the first individual in my direct ancestral lineage who will fail to do what all those before me have done. I will not give rise to the next generation. I will usher in the end of 4 billion years of continuity.

So because of this and after much thought, I have realized there is only one remaining way for me to contribute to humanity... I will need to remove my unsuitable genes from the gene pool so that I don’t compromise the viability of future generations. 

My genes are a threat to the welfare of our species. I did not choose for things to be this way. Unfortunately, I have failed by convention but I do hope to make it up to all of you by taking one for the team. Please just know I’m trying to help you all and I just want to do my part in the grand play that is Life. 

Note: I am really not interested in hearing anyone tell me that reproduction is not all important or that I’m thinking about biology too much. I really don’t think anything I’ve said is necessarily incorrect.",,Depressed

"Life tips from an old ballsack English is not my first language yada yada...

\- Be realistic. That goes for all aspects of your life (relationships, jobs, college, beauty ...): Most people don't have the money / time / emotional conditions to buy a mansion, have an Olympic-size swimming pool, have sex worthy of a porn movie every day, do plastic surgery, travel every year ... What I mean is, keep dreaming, but learn to appreciate simpler and more realistic things. Nowadays teenagers receive encouragement from all sides about how successful, wealthy, beautiful and hot all people are, and how you should be so as not to be a complete failure. Just don't believe the hype.

\- Nobody cares about your popularity in high school. With rare exceptions, you probably won't be in touch with almost anyone you went to school with, so don't be too stressed by their opinion.

\- No, life is not boring. Life seems boring to you because you feel so much more than adults (thanks, hormones), and it is for that same reason that you may think that people don't love you. But take the opportunity to cry a lot when you end a relationship, and fall in love like you're in a movie, and have fun like you're going to be a teenager forever.

\- Learn to put yourself more in the shoes of others (especially your parents). And yes, I am aware that some of you have parents who are complete imbeciles, but most of you do not. I know that carrying out tasks at home is a pain, and that following orders that you consider useless is also a pain, but believe me, you would also be without much patience if you worked all day, were responsible for creating someone else, made food, wash clothes, and have to beg someone to wash a dish or take out the trash.

\- You will probably never have as much free time as you do now, so invest at least a little of that time to learn things that will be useful in the future: taxes, work, extracurricular activities, learning a new language ... It's more worth going fewer parties now and have a better job in the future (to have money to spend on parties lol)

\- Eventually you are going to have a relationship, and have sex, so relax.

"Sensorimotor OCD and suicideSince August of last year, I've been obsessed with the physical sensation of breathing. This initially came from an immense cannabis-triggered anxiety attack, which then latched onto how short of breath I felt in those days.

Like any other affliction, it seems to fluctuate from being tolerable most days, to being something that makes me have multiple panic attacks on a daily basis. Hyperventilation and this naturally go hand in hand, since because I'm unwillingly focused on every breath I take, I end up getting more oxygen in than my body really needs.

My life doesn't have a lot going for it right now, even though compared to last year, I'm probably over the moon. I have a job after being unemployed for more than a year (even though I hate work with a passion, regardless of whatever job it is), and am in the first romantic relationship I've ever been in in my life.

Regardless of all of these positives, this breathing obsession ebbs and flows to the point where the past three quarters of a year have felt like a long-winded dark night of the soul. If things get worse again, I feel as though I want to fade to black, for good.

I'll miss my partner, I love him to pieces. I'll miss the few friends that call once in a blue moon, but I just don't know if I can live with this anymore. I've tried half a dozen antidepressants, I've tried eating better, I've tried exercising, I've gone to therapy and practiced CBT, and nothing's worked.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to hurt my partner, but I don't know how much longer I can go on living like this.

My kids (9, 5) are my (40M) everything. I'm not always the best parent. I had abusive parents and am trying like hell to break the cycle. I don't have any role models and am flying blind. I could use your help. 
This morning, my 5 year old threw away a Christmas present (a science experiment book) that arrived late (yesterday). It's from his uncle. He tossed it because he thought it was boring and didnt like it. I was crushed to see this, because it was a thoughtful gift intended for the family (we 3) to use together.
I told my 5 yo that what he did was wrong. I told him to bring me his 2 favorite stuffed animals. I intended to put them in 'time out' and let him earn them back w good behavior.
He instead brought down his two least favorite stuffed animals to outsmart me.
I then confiscated the 3 stuffed animals in his room, and reminded him that these 3 were his least favorite so he shouldn't care. I threatened to throw them away, like he threw away the book. I haven't, but now I'm stuck.
I don't want to take away all his toys. I've seen numerous posts on this sub about how doing so is counterproductive and eventually I'll run out of stuff to take away and he'll just resent me.

im 15, have 5 diagnosed mental illnesses, am an ex drug addict, and i really want to kill myself tonight. last night i asked my girlfriend if she wanted to do anything on valentines day. she said no. she hasn't texted me since. she refused to talk to me in the class we have together. i took her to new york city on sunday for an esports event, and she said she really enjoyed it. i don't fucking know what the fuck i did wrong. she's a lifelong friend, and she's the only reason why i haven't tried to kill myself again. it seems like our relationship is destroyed. i won't be able to live with that. i really want to be dead. i didn't deserve her. she's pretty, athletic, and really, incredibly smart. im horrendously ugly, severely mental ill, and as practically intelligent as a box of hair.

"something very weird, apparently a grown man attended a 6th grade class pretending to be a kid when that kid was absent. The man wasn't affiliated with the family. (true) I remembered from earlier today this happened and I just wanted to share. So kids were not turning on their cameras in phys ed class so the teacher told us it was basic safety. She told us this thing, which creeped me out. So in a 6th grade class, btw 6th grade is the lowest grade in my school and thankfully I finished 6th grade quite some time ago, so she told everyone to turn on their cameras. And 6th graders must have some decency, because all of them actually turned on the camera. And she saw, one of the kids cam's, was a grown man. The family was notified and they said they did not know this man, the kid was supposed to be absent for that day, and they upped their security I think. But, what the heck? A grown man? Who is it? Like, how does that happen? I am seriously worried for that kid, Im hoping the account was just hacked, because I don't know all the details, and if that man was attending from the home of the kid, on their computer, then I am VERY worried.

"Im in quite the predicament I have a big issue: A deathly fear (or hatred) of failure that leads to Self punishment for any amount of failure.

The reason it's weird is because my fear of failure doesn't prevent me from getting things done but it kills my motivation and drive to do because any mistakes make me mad at myself.

My mom is kinda helping me and she suggested that i try forcing myself to fail for extended periods of time.   
I can't. I physically can't do it for more than 2 minutes. She says the point is that i stop feeling like a piece of human waste when i fail but when i try to force myself to fail my body just doesn't work, it actively makes me avoid failing.

I might have to start doing water color paintings because that's what really hurts. Whenever i do them i start hating myself because ""It doesn't look good"". That's a problem though, i can't make myself keep going through those thoughts, as they pile up and make me feel worse and worse over time

"Don't be afraid to call out on your teacher's bullshit. I just did so in the past 2 weeks and succeeded. Let me give you guys some context first. I'm taking Organic Chemistry 1 virtually over zoom in college right now and there have been some unfair quizzes that have been given out to us. Each quiz is worth about 11% of our grade in which there are 5 quizzes total through out the semester. About 2 weeks ago, I took the 2nd quiz of the semester in which I did pretty shitty on (20/30 or 66%). I actually studied my ass off for this quiz but it didn't matter since the quiz was hard af and was unfair imo. Even though the class average for that quiz was in the 50s, the professor basically told everyone that they weren't going to tutoring enough lmao. The 3rd quiz that I took 2 days ago was basically the same as the 2nd quiz where it was unfair and everyone did shit. So, I sat my ass down in the past two weeks writing 7600+ words worth of e-mails to my professor basically exposing every single problem that there was with the course. I was surprised when I copied and pasted all of my e-mails into a google doc and I saw that I had written a shit ton of words lol. In the end, my professor and his coworkers admitted to being a failure of a teacher and are making changes to the course as we speak. Below, I linked a google document of the entire e-mail exchange in which I copied and pasted them. If you want to read the short novel I spent 15+ hours typing, you are free to do so.

TLDR: I took some unfair quizzes so I wrote a novel of an e-mail to my professor which made him admit that he was a failure.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aMk3oDBZbh7udDqezV6c2NMLro70uWXcNDXZUyrRNAI/edit?usp=sharing

TLDR of the email exchange:
Me: Your quiz was unfair and bullshit
Professor: Lol it happens, try harder next time
Me: Bruh, your class is shit
Professor: I guess I'll do something about it (Not really)
Me: Here's why your class is shit... (Many paragraphs later)
Professor: Alright, good point. I'll actually do something about it.
Everyone still does shit on the next quiz
Me: I'm now going to expose you and your coworkers bullshit and laziness.

"If your parents constantly fight but still have positive interactions, don't worry. Hihi, noticed nowadays a lotta parents argue and many peeps dont know what to do. I want you to know:

**PARENTS ARGUING IS NORMAL, AND NOT WORRYING IN ANY WAY.**

I mean, you fight with your siblings, or even your friends. Your parents are humans and they also have emotions. Two human beings will always have differing ideas and eventually it will end.

If your parents still have positive interactions when they are not arguing, then everything is perfectly fine and normal- everyone needs a break from each other some way or the other. 

But, if your parents insult each other **CONSTANTLY (insulting rarely is not something to be worried about: you probably insulted your friend when pissed off with him/her),** then just be wary because this may be the start/in the middle of a toxic relationship you were never aware of.

**WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE ARGUING PARENTS**

Its kinda difficult to have the same behavour because of the different circumstance, but I'd advice you do something actually useful but at the same time do the things you would regularly do. 

**Try not to eavesdrop. It's none of your business.** Listen to music, or read an interesting book. Just do something that will distract you from the situations.

 **Also, don't give a shit. Using the same friendship analogy, most of your other friends don't give a crap if you are in a fight with someone else and won't get involved.** 

Lastly, don't get involved. If your parents involve you then it is their problem; not yours.

"Hi. I just failed to end my life, and would like to discuss where to go from here.Hello, whoever is reading this. 

I [21M] have recently returned home from what has become the longest walk of my life. About five hours ago I tried and failed to successfully hang myself in the wilderness a few miles from my house.

There has been no real history of self-harm or suicise attempts made in my life before - yes, I have been upset at loss before - but I have never manifested my depression in a physical form such as suicide. 

In the last six months I have experienced the following events (in no order): the ending of my 18-month engagement, the loss of my long-standing family cat (of 14 years), the suicide of a distant family member last November, the loss of my job through stress/extraneous factors, two physical fights with both a stranger and a friend, and severe alcohol dependency. 

At the turn of the new year a friend and I decided to try and turn our lives around, and aspire to greater things to get ourselves out of our respective situations (she had also been split up with, and had lost three family members in the past 12 months). Over January we both felt absolutely on top of the world, achieving wonderful leaps and bounds in what we wanted to do. 

Ultimately though in the last two weeks I have felt like I am getting nowhere. I can't get even part-time work, my ex-fiancé hasn't made good on promises to return certain items and money, I have lost a lot of friends due to them not knowing how to handle talking with me, and I have taken up drinking more and more without realising it. 

I still wish to end my life, and cannot currently see things getting any better, even over a long-term period. I am hoping there is somebody here who can talk through this with me. I am not looking necessarily to be talked down from my stance, or dissuaded, but I need an unbiased ear - mostly because there is no-one else and I don't want to bring my close friend into this as she has progressed so well and made something of herself. 

Many thanks.

"Flirting and dating advice for y'all #Let's start with the basic (this apply for everyone) :

First of all never ask someone out if you don't know them. Try to spend time with them and find common interests.

Once you know them well, you have to make them understand that you are interested: 
- Text them first
- Initiate conversation irl
- Compliment them
- Make eye contact and smile at them
- Make them laugh
- Flirt

Easier said than done, I know but I strongly regret that I haven't done that with my old crushes. Take your time and it will come together.


If they feel uncomfortable they are maybe shy or not interested give them time to think.


Once you did the previous step you now have 4 choices:

1) Ask them to hang out (only you and them)
2) Improvise a date (grab your friends and wait for them to leave and then you will be alone with your crush)
3) Kiss them while you hang out (but before drop a signs like a big hug or your hand around their neck, head on shoulder or something like that)
4) Never ask them out and cry everyday for the next month


I highly recommend you to not try the fourth option

If you choose the date (or hang out) and you are really shy, find an activity that you both like (so you can concentrate on the activity instead of thinking what you have to say). Also don't try to be someone else, you are perfect as you are.


Now it's an avengers level threats, it's late, you ""finished the date"" and you have multiple choices:

1) Kiss them or tongue kiss them: Doesn't matter if you are good or bad at kissing, as long as you both enjoy it, it's fine.
2) Invite them to your place: If you want to make out privately or have the thing
3) If you are still really shy and don't want to kiss them or anything, have a physical contact (hold hands or something). Then agree to have a second date

#General advice: 

Don't act different with your crush and with others.

Don't be afraid of doing a move to your crush in public you will probably regret it in 2 weeks.

If you are really shy, try to have a mutual friend with your crush for easier communication.

"To any teenager who is going through a breakup.. **I. Introduction**

I have been through many breakups, and I can say for sure that those are the most traumatizing and difficult experiences one has to go through in first world countries. As one of my friend's stated when I asked him for advice, he said: "" You know you've been raised in a kinda spoiled Environnement if heartbreak is your first issue"".  I will clarify this later, meanwhile, by break up I mean: losing someone you had a really strong romantic connection with.

(Friendships and other stuff do not count because they are not as intense and the hormonal system is less involved, anyway!)

So, first, of, before going into the how-to ""heal"" after a breakup part, which assumes that you have broken up for whatever reason already, let's go into :

**II. Why you should break up - How to know when you actually SHOULD break up for your own benefit.**

1) You have thoughts about breaking up. Those do not appear randomly. It's normal to have some in a long term relationship but if 3 months in you are thinking about it, it's a good idea to dig deeper into it.  


2) Your relationship is dysfunctional in any way: your partner poison drips you, you're not on the same page in terms of actualization, you feel like it's toxic, resentment has built up over the years, there is a clear lack of communication, the relationship doesn't fit your needs.  


3) You live far away from each other. If you are leaving somewhere for more than 2 weeks and you are under 25, and the relationship isn't that serious and heavy, break up. You'll find someone else. There is NO POINT in torturing yourself for nothing, spending hours and hours for something that will not work out.

Long-distance relationships have always been a huge mystery for me, because as I said once: You might as well be talking to a clever robot on skype and that would be exactly the same. You don't share real-life experiences with the person. Hence, it's pointless. Anyway!

Here comes the tricky part, you don't wanna see this. You don't wanna realize your relationship is shitty and go through a breakup. Because :  


"" I have regular sex, it's comfortable, I'm used to it, yeah he/she is not the most perfect but I'm not gonna go through the hustle of trying to find someone else, that's too much work, learning pick up or going out with my friends, getting my social skills in check, I'll just stay with him/her and live a comfortable life, etc""  


Once you've been in a relationship for a while, you're used to the comfort and you will sometimes even agree to undergo abuse just to stay in homeostasis and in comfort because you hate change. And only when you look back, you realize how toxic your past relationships were.  


4) If overall the whole situation is messed up, someone cheated on someone else, etc, so on and so forth. I'm not gonna list this for ages, simply: **be honest with yourself and don't try to hold on and stay comfortable.**

**III. How To break up and When to break up.**  


Once you made the decision, do not be soft. I repeat, this is extremely key: DO NOT BE SOFT.

See them only once, and talk about it. Exchange any belongings if needed, and give them a strict deadline to move out, but otherwise, CUT THEM FROM YOUR LIFE FOREVER. Until the end of times. If they go full drama on you and wanna fix stuff, and you feel like you can't handle it, simply RUN AWAY and never talk to them again. This may sound horrible, but once their ego is hurt, they are not on your side. When someone feels hurt, they will try to damage you as much as humanly possible so you stay and regret your decision. Do not get caught up in that toxic crap and RUN AWAY if needed. Cut all ties with the person, burn all the boats, explode all the bridges. Forever and as fast as you can. There is no coming back. Block them from anywhere, cut ties with any friends you have in common, blacklist their number and cut all contact forever.  
There is nothing worst that spending months in pointless breaking up drama and when finally it's over you're even more destroyed and lack resources to rebuild yourself.

Also, for common courtesy, please avoid breaking up during exams for college students, important project deadlines, at family events, birthdays, and stuff like that. Do not be soft, but also stay human and humble. This is most likely someone you loved and they deserve respect and being treated correctly no matter what.

 **IV. Healing after a breakup.** 

 

The pain will be horrible, but avoid numbing it too much. No alcohol, no drugs. All you have to do now is not falling into a depressive state, don't become addicted, and simply cope with the pain as best as you can. I'd recommend even going to Church if it helps. Find anything non-addictive that will boost your emotional state.

After a while, the physical pain will kinda disappear, but the emotional pain will remain for some time.

So, to get past the reactive, coping stage, you have to :

1) Start believing you can overcome it. Hope and believe.  A lot. For this, know that you are not alone. And watch as MUCH break up videos as possible. Also realize, that only good things are gonna come out of this. And your next relationship is gonna be only better.  


2) Get rid of the GHOST MEMORIES syndrome. This is by far the most annoying shit on earth. Your brain is gonna bombard you with memories. Oh hello there, remember that time when...Sometimes when you enter your own bathroom your brain is gonna be like: REMEMBER, SHE WAS THERE. Avoid places that remind you of your past partner.  


3) Look up content on handling emotions and practice that a lot. I recommend Teal Swan, once more. When a memory comes up, get rid of the charged emotion that comes with it, and it shall make you free.  


4) Get in touch with your inner problems. Work with :

\- Your self-esteem  
\- Self- Love, which is extremely key because you will feel unloved at first.  
\- Self-worth  
And whatever other stuff you find useful. Self-actualize a lot.  


5) Make changes in your life :  
\- Practice a sport  
\- Drink green tea

=&gt; Get rid of the biological attachment to the other person, cleanse your body.  


6) Do not immediately start doing pick up and don't try to find someone else. You will only attract people that are in the same emotional state and that will result only in bad rebound relationships. Trying to cope with pain this way is extremely counter-productive and will only result in worsening your condition.  
 

**V. Raising to the stars.**  


Once the physical pain stops, will come to a new stage. The stage where you will use the emotional leverage to get your shit together.  


Here, we will go from being reactive to being active and striving for a better life and a better future.

 You will have insane amounts of leverage, so after a week or so :  


You can start doing pick up (again :D) and having some casual sex.  
Also, pick up new good habits, start meditating, invest yourself in your work, do all the shit you've been trying to do but never dared to, expand your social circle, etc.  
And of course, put in the work.  
The pain is gonna burn through the layers of your ego and you're gonna become purer. Enjoy it.  
And proactively seek out opportunities to do more self-actualization work 

**VII Last Words.**  


If you're still unsure whether you should break up or not, ask yourself "" If I were a knight, would I stay in the same village for the rest of my life, or Would I go on and explore what's around, fight epic battles, and reach my potential? ""  


I choose to do so. And It paid off. If you ever feel seriously desperate, remember Eckhart Tolle: This too shall pass.  
I've broken up with my 1-year gf and immediately try to geet with another girl who rejected me, and I was left with nothing.  
I rebuild everything from scratch and it was the best year of my entire life.  
I really hope it will work out for you and open up great opportunities.  


Also, as my friend stated: Being in pain is a luxury. Some people don't have enough money to eat, and you're here bitching about heartbreak. Do not deny your pain and don't feel shame for it, but also put it in its context. It feels like the end of the world, but it's not. You are simply...fragile. Read antifragile by Nessim Taleb to get more info on that topic.  


This is kinda true. Remember to appreciate what you have in life and all the great opportunities. If you are still really young, such as below 25, do not worry much about breakups. In five years from now, hell, even 1 year from now It won't even matter anymore.  


Best of luck and feel free to ask any questions!",,Anxious

Plus, my Mom has been taking her anger about moving to a new place and working from home and setting up the house on me. She’s stressed about unpacking, I get yelled at. She’s stressed about not going anywhere during the day, I get yelled at. She’s stressed about doing everything alone (even though I offer to help), I get yelled at. My mom doing this has led to me having pent up anger that I take out on my sister by accident, making my Mom even more mad. It’s just so frustrating how no matter what I do, my mom gets mad at me.

For example: I've opened up so much to my gf, and feel like she should've left me by now. And I think that maybe she doesn't do it because she feels bad for me? Because when she asked me out, she didn't know all of my problems, as I saved them all up?

I feel like I'm just a charge for them and that I'd be better off dead. I really can't think of cutting myself to death. I just think I and everyone would be better off if I just... Dropped dead.

Also, I need to mention this, just in case. Up until I was 10 or 12 years old or so, there were constant fights in my house. Like domestic abuse. F*ck, I even had to accompany my mother when I was 14, to go report my father to the police. So, yeah... They made me insecure, probably asocial, and a long list of shit....

"Sexualizing fictional children is not wrong. P.S. In most cases with popular anime, they usually aren't children, but teenagers. People call them children to strengthen their argument by making them seem younger then they actually are. 

There are two main reasons for this.

1. They are fictional.  
Let me as you this: If I play Call of Duty, am I a veteran? If I play Fortnite, am I a war criminal? No. I don't see why this should be any different. Sexualizing fictional (as in cartoons, anime, etc.) will never be wrong, because they aren't real. Also, they aren't actual children. They are depictions of children. We call them children because it's easier to just call them what it's depicting.
2. No one is being hurt. If I sexualize a fictional child, I am not manipulating anyone into doing it. I am not grooming, or raping, or molesting, or abducting, or beating, or even killing anyone, in some cases. There is no grooming a folder in procreate. Why? Because they aren't real.",,Normal

freshman year, when i was diagnosed, i had pretty much hit rock bottom. i didn’t care about anything, i’d missed over a month of school, i was too depressed to shower or even get out of bed. the only thing keeping me alive was the fear of hurting my family and friends. i tried lexapro, zoloft, effexor, paxil, and vistaril to no avail. prozac miraculously worked, if only for a few months. i quit therapy and quickly fell back into old habits, stupidly keeping it from my parents.

my mom noticed me slipping recently, but she doesn’t know how bad it’s gotten. my psychiatrist maxed out my prozac dosage and put me on wellbutrin and concerta, but i haven’t noticed a difference in the last few weeks. i want to end everything, but i’m still too scared of hurting people. lately i’ve been thinking about faking a kidnapping and just killing myself in the middle of the woods. i don’t know.

As the title says, I think deep down, I don't want to die. But at the same time, I really really want to. I had often fantasised about running away and getting incurrable amnesia but obviously, killing oneself seems easiest. These past few days have been especially hard, for some reason. I always try to remind myself of how much I love nature, and the sky when it turns that nice greenish hue around the mountains as the sun goes down. And how much I like the rain, or ballet, or my cat. And that being so utterly alone is a normal thing and to remember my favourite quote; ""family not by blood, but by bond"". Or, however it goes. I don't know. But with everything going on (or not, in this case), I feel like I'm never going to feel better.

And I lost one of my grandma last week (my father's mother).

I don't know if i'm mentally strong enough now, but i'm at a point where i don't know what to do anymore with my life. I mean i'm living with my mother, i have some friends at school, i'm still in very good terms with my brother and my sister, all of this is very fine, but i'm mentally not doing good. I'm crying almost every night alone in my bed.I'm 18 and I've been single my entire life because i'm too shy, and i'm afraid to bother girls i found cute because i have too much respect for them, which kinda sucks because i'm feeling alone and that's hurting a lot, and especially when i'm seeing that all my friends are in love with someome else...

Tbh i'm That type of friend who is the funny guy at school, but when i'm at home, i'm not good at all, because i have almost no friends to talk to. I'm spending a lot of time on my computer playing video games with my best friend trying to get away from the reality, but it's not always working.

I think your telling to yourself ""why don't you go speak to your family or friends"" and that's true, but i don't want to do it because I don't want my Mother my brother and my sister to be worried about me because they were a lot recently for my dad, and i don't want to talk about it to my friend because i don't want to bother them with my problems, they probably have some on their side.

But what are you supposed to say when people ask if you're okay? I want to tell them the truth, but no one really wants to hear that I just want to die or feel normal again, but I never will. I tried to talk to medical, I told them I don't really want to live and that I feel miserable all the time for no reason... they told me to come back if I became worse.

I finally worked up what little courage I have (pathetic, I know) to talk to someone and tell them that I was on antidepressants that I got from a doctor back home. It was humiliating. They made comments about how I was crazy. The military won't really help you.

I tried to get help. I did everything they told me. But I can't bring myself to say anything other than fine when people ask how I am anymore.

"How to solve procrastination and be productive. (It’s long, so bear with me if you really want to know how to solve it)



To solve procrastination, one must first understand why they procrastinate:

A psychological theory called the self-worth theory of motivation describes that procrastination is rooted from our self worth.
Many of us define our self-worth by our productivity, how much we’ve accomplished and what we’re capable of.

Let us take a classic example of studying for a test,

• We are terrified of performing poorly on that paper because we feel our value depends on it.
• So when we procrastinate and put in less effort, we’re doing so as a form of self - protection.
• That way if we earn a bad result, it doesn’t mean we’re not talented, smart or worthy, we just didn’t spend enough time on it.
• In the exam halls, right before a test, when you ask your friend how much they’ve studied, a usual response is “I barely studied” or “only like 2 hours”. Why? because if they don’t achieve, then they have built this excuse not only for themselves but for other too.
• Isn’t strangely flattering when we hear a parent, teacher or a student say “you’ve got a lot of potential, just you have to put more time into it.”?




We don’t procrastinate because we don’t care or we’re to lazy, we certainly do want it, but if we do try and put in that extra effort and fail we would be so ashamed and instantly self destruct.

• We find ourselves pulled between two equally strong and compelling forces: the drive to achieve and THE FEAR OF FAILURE. So we completely feel stuck.

• And we only find ourselves doing the work when it’s 2 hours before the deadline and the fear of not getting the paper done out weighs the fear of not doing it perfectly (fear of failure).




Now, a FEW MAJOR WAYS TO STOP PROCRASTINATION are:

1. BREAK DOWN THE STEPS: Doing so will increase our expectancy to complete the task since smaller projects seem much easier to accomplish than large projects.


2. KEEP THE TASKS SMALL: One of the hacks to procrastination is the pomodoro technique.
If I sat down to study and told myself I need to study for 5 hours, I would be prone to getting distracted quickly. Instead, If I tell myself I only need to study 25 minutes, the task becomes far less daunting.


3. SET THE BAR LOW: Set the goal to something less than what you are actually capable of. This trick increases your expectancy to complete the task.


4. UNDERSTAND YOUR PERSONALITY TYPE: The issue with advice in general is that one suggestion can work wonders for one person, but not for another. So, find out about your personality type and find out a way that works the best for you. Myers–Briggs Type Test


5. GIVE YOURSELF A REWARD FOR COMPLETING THE WORK: If you feel your work is boring then you can create a reward yourself with something you like to encourage you to complete the task.


6. USE PARKINSON’S LAW TO YOUR ADVANTAGE: It states that work expands to fill the time allotted to it. (In other words, if you have only 30 minutes of work to do, but allot 2 hours to do it, you’ll end up spending the entire 2 hours to do it.)
So create artificial deadlines that force you to get the work done more efficiently.


I hope you are now on the path to solve your procrastination and be more productive than ever before. ✨





P.S. : I personally apply the “NOW OR NEVER” method to stop my procrastination. Basically if you need to complete a task you do it ASAP, if you leave it for later then you’ll be more prone to postpone it again and it eventually becomes a cycle and impacts you a lot unless you have really strong willpower and determination.",,Anxious

Do you think it is hard to kill someone when you choke them during sex?

I hope it is easy cause I want this guy to kill me tomorrow. 

I met him on grindr like a year ago. He was really rough, and I went home bruised with bite marks. And I love that because we all know I deserve to be hurt, and it's hard to hurt myself. I like when other people do it for me. That's why I post at this sub. I know I'll be ignored, and then I can feel horrible about who I am. 

Anyway, he asked me if he could choke me next time we fucked. I said yes. I didn't mean it. I just assumed I would never answer his texts. He texts every few months to see if I want to fuck. I always have an excuse not to. But something has been keeping me from completely ignoring him. Now I know what it is. Maybe he can get a little too rough when he chokes me. Maybe if I'm lucky he will accidentally kill me. 

He was so rough that I started crying last time,  and he got off on that. I think he thought I did, too. And he was right. It was painful, but I needed it. I needed to feel like I wasn't important. I needed to feel like tears don't stop cruelty.

I do all of the recommended things for people who are depressed (workout daily, eat healthy, sleep normally, be social, take meds, work hard, etc.). In fact, I am rather healthy in every way except mentally. However, I still desperately want to kill myself. 

I am not always sad. There are even periods of weeks where I am not suicidal. However, I've been suicidal agt least 3 days per week on average for the last 8 years. Even on the days I am not suicidal, I don't find any value in living.

I used to not kill myself because of what it would do to my friends and family. However, I am at a point in life in which I have no friends, and don't care much for my family or what happens to them. I have reached out to a dozen ""friends"" and nobody responds or cares. It seems like the perfect time for me to do it.

The only reason I haven't taken any action is that I don't have a good plan. I am not in an environment with good means of killing myself. I am still struggling to find a means that wouldn't involve terrible pain. However, I feel like soon enough, the pain won't even deter me. 

Since these thoughts have been so frequent, I realized that I am eventually going to kill myself. There seems to be no chance I would somehow overcome this ""illness"" before it takes me.

My parents are either disappointed with me or angry towards me, depending on their mood, and my younger brother has autism and wont voluntarily talk to me.

"Sorry. This ended up being a bit long.I'm sorry if my writing is incoherent. I've never written this out before and I don't really know how, but I feel the need to. Every fibre of my being feels like it's screaming out to die.

Ever since I was 6, I've displayed tendencies of depression. My childhood wasn't exactly normal, but I don't think it was that bad. I feel strange talking about this so normally, but I've kind of come to terms with it at this point. All I can remember is wanting to disappear - I don't know anything different, and I have no hopes or ambitions. I do everything out of pure convenience to make my life easier so I have to do less. My whole life, I've felt as if I am trapped in a dark cloud where time is moving slowly yet all at once at the same time.

I'm 16 now, and I think that when I have to become fully responsible for myself, I will die. I procrastinate constantly and the start of every new day makes me want to cry. Death isn't really that appealing honestly - I don't want to hurt people through my suicide but sleeping forever seems to be the only way to rid myself of this responsibility. I don't want to be too selfish, I'm a shitty enough person already. In primary school the concept of time was so foreign and blurred to me that I could just stare at a wall or sleep to do it, but everyone wants too much from me now. 
Procrastinating used to make me feel better as it put my mind off how shit I felt, but not anymore. I thought that not being sad was happiness, but it's really not, it's just indifference. If I lived a life where all I had to do was sleep, that would be heaven. I do want to be responsible for myself, but the very idea of work makes me break down and lose all energy. I guess I've given up.

I suppose it's a little bit beside the point, but I've started starving myself too. Not completely on purpose, sometimes I do it because emptiness gives me something to feel, but sometimes it's just because I just don't have the energy to eat. I don't think I have an eating disorder though, because there's no real reason behind it, I could probably stop at any time if I wanted to. I mean, I displayed similar actions as a kid as I'd eat 5 chocolate bars at once just for the hole it seemed to fill and I guess I still get the tendencies but I stopped that. I just want to feel something real again and even though I know this won't solve the problem, it makes me feel... something, at least.

I'm afraid to tell someone, not because of any possible stigma, but because of my own self-doubt. I am afraid that if I try to get help, I will be told that everything I am feeling is normal and there's nothing I can do about it because I've been forcing myself to appear normal for so long. Sometimes I wonder what would be worse - finding out there's something wrong with me or discovering I've been wrong all along. Every time I gathered up the courage to try when I was younger, all I could think about was all the adults who told me that because of my age, I couldn't understand real problems and that led to a real fear of being labelled an attention seeker. It's been 10 years since this started but I still feel like I'm stuck in the same place I was then, and I haven't advanced at all. At 10 I barely stopped myself from stabbing myself, and I honestly don't think I'll be able to stop myself now. I wonder if I'm still in the same mindset as then, really.

Apart from telling others to try and get professional help or whatever, it's not like I haven't tried to fix this. I've tried lots of methods but none of them seem to work. I just don't have the energy or patience. 

This was a bad idea to write. I feel worse than I did before now I've thought about this more, as if I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I'm sorry if you read this far, because I really don't think I'm strong enough to help myself. ",,Depressed

I'm only 20, and any time I try to open up to people about how I feel they just tell me I'm too young to understand how being depressed feels. They think it's a fucking joke and that I just want attention. Fuck them and their attention, I just want to feel something better then numbness. That is the absolute best feeling I've had in over 5 years, numbness. It's fucking pathetic. Normally it's just downright disdain for myself, loathing, etc. 

I fucking hate everyone. And it's not that I dislike everyone I know, it's that I either don't like them, or I care about them so much that it's the only thing keeping me here this long. And I hate them for it. I don't want them to be sad, but I don't want to be here. I tried to move away and let the bonds slowly fade away, but they can't. It doesn't work. And I know that I shouldn't do it for them, but that's a selfish way of thinking I feel. If I were on life support I'd want them to let me go. Why can't this be the same? I'll just say goodbye and that's it? It seems so simple.

I've tried before, but I failed. I was going to slit my wrists, but I didn't want to live through it and see the scars every day, reminding me I couldn't even fucking kill myself right. I've tried to poison myself, but I just blacked out for a few days and when I came to I was violently sick. My roommates at the time never noticed. I just need a way that I know will get the job done. No room for error. That's all I've been looking for.

Why can't I just get sick? That would be so much easier. Hell, I smoke for the sole reason that it might kill me since I can't seem to do it myself.

"Advice on personality Hello! I would like to ask the kind denizens of r/teenagers some questions regarding personality. I've had a rough time these past few years struggling with emotional numbness, and I'm anxious that it's had a negative effect on my personality. Things I believe it has affected are my motivation (which has made me a lazy prick who takes the path of least resistance almost all of the time), charisma (which has made me a very dull person to talk to as I cannot really relate to others problems or acheivements in a meaningfull way) and has dampened my will to help in a selfless way (I don't get any emotional reward from doing a good deed anymore, so it is harder to help others.) I feel jaded by it all, and can't for the life of me truly care for anything. I'm aware that some of these things are typically associated with autism, or other ailments on the autism spectrum like Asperger's, and I have formal letters from my therapist attesting to me being autistic. However, these traits never have been as strong as they are now. Is this normal? What advice would you give to someone in my position?",,Anxious

"worst depression of my life, shut-in, trying to move back to a place i can be mentally stableI don't really know how to start this. I guess I'm just in the worst downswing of my life right now and I'm in pain all the time. 

I lived in California for the greater part of my life (from when I was about 5-6 to earlier this year, with some brief and temporary stays in the pacific northwest). I did a year of community college there, met my partner of 2 years, and I was genuinely at peace with my life despite struggling with depression and anxiety as a result of my childhood trauma throughout high school and into college)

I'm entirely dependent on my mom right now and haven't moved out yet, and the problem is here. My mom recently got a boyfriend and took me and everything we own to live with him in Oklahoma. We're in a small town, and I haven't seen my partner in months. Online chatting is good, but I can't go outside (I'm autistic and trans and absolutely terrified of people in this part of the country) and my social anxiety has skyrocketed. I'm suicidal and depressed all the time, its getting worse now that it's fall because of my seasonal depression, and I'm constantly plagued with crushing homesickness. I feel like a prisoner in my own life, and I don't even know where to begin with getting out. Sometimes I feel like I would just rather not exist at all because of how much it hurts to be here.

Memories of being with my partner in California and all the things I had there that I don't here keep slamming into me like a freight train over and over, and I'm melting down and having panic attacks every single day. I can't go more than a few hours without crying and I'm dependent on the internet to distract myself. I really, really need to get a job and move back to California, but because of my disabilities it's really terrifying to think of moving out of my mom's house. I've never been independent before and I feel suffocated where I am right now.

I've had patches where I was so actively suicidal I almost decided to take pills. It's not at that point right now, but my suicidal ideation is a constant undercurrent trapping me in my misery and making me feel like I'm going to die here. This room, town, and entire state feels like my prison and I don't know how I'm ever going to get out.

I don't know what I'm really expecting to get out of this. Maybe I'm just venting, but yeah.

"Goodbye everyone - taking my stock pile of pills after work todayI just literally can't any longer. I am sitting at my desk at work sobbing. I realized that I haven't accomplished anything since graduating college 3 years ago and I don't even know how that happened. I can't continue to live like this. I hate my job and it feels like a prison that I have to endure 9 hours per day. I can't even kill myself without my job getting in my way - I have to wait until my work day is over so I don't have to be pestered by people wondering where I went. What will they do without their corporate robot?

I want to settle down with someone but I ruin everything because I am too obsessed with seeking short term satisfaction / endorphins from attention from multiple guys. I engage in risky behavior as a means of trying to save my own life yet it is placing me further and further away from my goal of having a family. 

So, what is the fucking point? There is none. I don't even have the energy to write out a suicide note so I suppose it will be easier for my family and friends if I just disappear in quiet.

Only 1 hour and 15 minutes until I can go home and end myself. Wow, the relief is consuming. ",,Depressed

"One Year To This Today marks one year of me and my partners relationship. I texted him ""Happy One Year Anniversary"" and he only said ""No"" and blocked me on every social media page.

Maybe if im lucky he wasn't in the mood for me and just blocked me, or maybe he just didn't love me anymore. It hurts, I learned that ending relationships hurt they, really hurt.

"I’m worried about one of my Idols: Millie Bobby Brown I’m a really huge fan of Millie Bobby Brown. For those that don’t know, she’s from Stranger Things and the new Netflix movie Enola Holmes. She’s my first celebrity crush and she’s very famous at 37 million Instagram followers. I even met her last year. I think she’s a great person as she offers great advice, is very relatable, and is a good person. 

However, some people on r/13or30 who thinks she looks old enough to be a mom, and on Twitter people keep making a homo meme out of her. I know she has more love than haters but she took the Imagine meme on TikTok personally when most people were just having fun with it. She said she has developed anxiety because of hate she gets and I think she’s starting to think she has more haters than lovers, which is not the case from what I see. She doesn’t get that much hate as someone like Brie Larson.

Some people on reddit really want Drake to have sex with her, and it disgusts me. I think if she saw that she would probably feel disgusted.

Since she’s probably thinking she has more hate than love, I just don’t want to see one of my biggest idols kill herself because of some incels online. Are people really bullying her or am I over thinking it?",,Anxious

"I've been scaring myself to the point where I can't leave my bed So recently I've gotten into watching scary movies, scary Reddit videos, and all that jazz. I watch them constantly and I find it enjoyable. My parents have even started recommending scary movies to me. But recently my imagination has started to run amuck. The stories they tell in movies have stuck inside my head, I was once watching a video about murderers hiding in closets and under beds. So some nights  I'll hear a noise and I'll start freaking out into thinking it's a murderer coming into my house trying to kill everyone in my home. It has gotten to the point where I can't turn a corner without fearing for my life. I live in a safe community, the worst thing that's ever happened near here has just been a couple of fires. But I can't go to the bathroom without looking everywhere and even worrying that someone may be in my vents.

"Super Depressed and considering doing it.So I am not real good at writing things (just one of my many faults) but here goes.

I am 21 year old male that has a whole bunch of diagnosed mental problems, namely ADHD, Depression, and anxiety.  I am currently enrolled at a community college taking classes to be computer support person.  However, I feel like this isnt the right thing for me. I come from an incredibly conservative family that always was incredibly strict on me, and pressure me all the time.  I am extremely introverted, indecisive and incredibly fearful of failure.  I feel like I have no friends anymore, and also i am questioning everything about myself.  I have no hobbies or beliefs and feel meaningless.  Now that that's out of the way, let me get into detail. 

My life has been alot of ups and downs, and for the most part it's been down.  Throughout most of my high school life I was depressed and very anxious.  However, for awhile after that, I was for the most part happy.  However, after changing colleges twice, and my majors almost a dozen times, I am beginning to become more depressed.   Currently, I am taking classes for computer support, however, compared to my classmates I feel oh so stupid!  I have had interest in computers for a long time, however, my parents made pick up Chemistry instead (not to say I didn't like chemistry).   But I feel so lost and stupid compared to my classmates who know way more then I do.  I don't know if this is the right program for me, but I don't want to spend more time and money on school then I have to.  But I can't drop out, because my family is pressuring me to go.

I am extremely introverted.  I would love to make friends with people and talk to those around me, but I can never bring myself to do so.  And everytime I do try, I make a fool of myself and murmur and stutter everything feebly to them.  All my friends have moved on, leaving me behind to wallow in my misery. 

I have a low self image, as I am a failure and a fat dumbass.  I try going to the gym, but I feel scared, because everyone looks at me weird, because i am the only fat person there.   

I have no passions or hobbies.  I try to find things that i like to do. But honestly, nothing seems to bring me joy.   That can be applied to my whole life, nothing is bringing me joy in my life.  No one is helping me either.  I just feel alone.

So.  I am not suicidal yet, but I am honestly getting to that point, which is why I'd like some support or some advice for how i can value and joy in my life again.  How I can open up without being awkward.  Anything is appreciated.
(Also, sorry for trailing off at the end, I need to leave for class).

I should have done this a long time ago.  I've used up all of my 'try again' and hope shit.  I can't stand the pain anymore.  There are tons of ways of doing it.

"How bad is underage drinking ? Of course, my parents will never allow me or buy me alcohol (they also don't drink since it's haram). I've bought some tools to make my own alcohol. I'm using bread yeast actually, it's not best but good enough.

Anyways, I'm only 14. I just want to try once. I told mom I'm making vinegar , and part of making vinegar is making alcohol.  

I would guess the bread yeast I'm using makes from 7-9 % ethanol wine. I'm using grape juice btw.

How dangerous would it be to just try maybe half a cup?  This drink is high in sugar but got enough ethanol to be drunk.

I'm not planning on making this drink regularly , since turning it into vinegar takes time, so at maximum i can if i want to try it once every 1.5 month.

"I've been in a weird place for years and think I need help.I don't think I can find the words for this, but I'll give it a go. Opening up is hard.

Some obligatory context: I'm a 21 year old male living in Finland, or 22? I don't even know, I recently told a girl at a bar that I was 19 for some reason. I can't keep up with getting older. I've read a lot of posts in here. For some reason I don't see myself fitting in most of them.

&amp;nbsp;

I consider myself fairly attractive, I enjoy talking and being with women. I come from a poor family and managed to get in to a University in Finland and the tests for getting in can be quite challenging for many. I don't see myself as a failure, in fact I am very proud of myself. I have lots of friends, I absolutely love my best friend and I am the luckiest man alive to have met him. I love myself, I love being myself.. I enjoy the smallest things in life and love to sing and dance, going to concerts. I am happy every day, even in work after school and I work at McDonald's.


&amp;nbsp;

So here's the kicker... I pay a lot of money to enjoy myself, and I don't have a problem with that.. but for example every time I go to a concert I forget all about it the next day, I can't remember anything, not the feeling, can't even recall what songs they played. Happens with everything and im left in my bed wondering is that it?

Really doesn't help my case that a few years ago, my world somehow completely shifted. I never thought about killing myself before, but now when I think about it.. It feels like I've known for years that I want to do it. And I really do. I don't understand why it's such a taboo, a disease one might call it. Honestly the only reason I haven't done it is because people close to me have ""made"" me promise to live for them if I can't live for myself.

I used to think that my world will shift again when I have my own family, holy shit what if it doesn't? I left my last girlfriend because I can't make a commitment to staying alive. We still see each other often because I can't let go. I wish she could just move on on her own...

We’ve been together for half a year now, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but she helped me get out of a toxic relationship and saved me from my suicide attempts as well. I want the best for her, but I feel like my past emotions aren’t helping as I’m getting thoughts that I’m responsible for everything, and I feel my negative thoughts stirring back up. I had already felt quite sad recently, but with this information I know that I can’t come to a logical answer nor give the best advice at the moment. I understand I can’t do everything to help and listening to her and everything is helpful, but I want to do more, just to prevent her from doing anything, but I’m clueless. In my time of need, I went to a therapist, but she doesn’t have that option. I hope there is some good souls in the world that maybe can help me and give me some tips on how to help. She had helped me get through my hard times and I don’t want to let her down. She means the world to me and I don’t know what to do. Anyone, just anyone who reads this, please help me.

"Reddit, I can't stop thinking about it.I've battled with depression my entire adult life, mostly built around self-worth issues and an inability to deal with failure. I got out of highschool, and things got better. I was in college for a couple of years, but eventually dropped out due to grades (again, crippling fear of trying and failing) and to help support my family after the death of our mother.

But it's all falling apart now. I've been back at home for over a year now, and things seem okay. I have a stable job, an interest, and am slowly saving money. But I don't *feel* okay. Every day I start out happy, and end up borderline in tears, thinking about braining myself. It started as a wayward thought here and there, and now I'm spending hours a day, fantasizing about how if I was dead, I wouldn't be ashamed of myself anymore. My body, my position academically, my relational status.

I'm incapable of being proud of myself. On the rare occasions where I work up the courage to actually try something, I'm ashamed of my work, knowing it could have been better. I've been slowly growing more and more ashamed of myself for years, and the weight of self-hatred is crushing me and leaving no room for any kind of positive thought or emotion. Combine this with the fact that all of my immediate family is either dead or dying, and I've lost the will to cope. I don't want to be the last in my line, wallowing away in my own failure until I croak 50 years from now. I want it over now. I want the pain to stop.",,Depressed

"Hey so I need some advice. So a little while back my English teacher assigned our class a paper about Gen Z slang. The assignment was to choose a word that I use and other people in my generation use and write about it. So I chose a word and wrote it but now my teacher is giving us a chance to rewrite. Since I didn’t do too great on the first one, I rewrote it with a different word. This time, I chose a twitch emote (weirdchamp) and my English teacher reviewed. But after that, I thought of a funny idea. I thought that I can rewrite it again but using a different emote (Jebaited) (which means to trick). So he’d think I’m writing about weirdchamp but I’m actually gonna turn in the paper about “Jebaited”, and it’d be funny because that would be a Jebait. I’m very tempted to do it but I’m kind of nervous. Should I do it or not?",,Anxious

"EveningI'm really never sure what I'm supposed to write here. I think I'm writing in the hope that someone will read what I say and consider it, but I'm not all too sure if there's anything to take into consideration. I doubt anything could be taken away from reading my thoughts, not anything positive in any case, so thank you for taking the time anyway, if you happen to be reading this.

I feel very weighed down by societal expectations. The way we need to speak, the intonation and language expected as we go about the life of a functioning person. The ""work voice"". It's really a small thing, but it always annoys me. It feels disingenuous to be like that, like I'm betraying myself and living a lie. I really can't stand it. Which is a pretty childish way to think, I understand. But I don't think I'll ever get over it, I see it as dehumanizing, factory standard, planned and mechanical. There's no warmth there, it's nothing.

I guess most of my complaints about living are in a similar vein. I wouldn't call myself a deviant in most contexts. But there's it feels there's no point where I feel ""Life"". I'm sitting here, at my desk with my computer, I paid more money for all of this than I did my car. And at the end of the day, I'll freely admit this, I know I'm not unique here by far, it was just to distract myself. I'm going to eat some food, and I'm going to go to bed once I've finished my tequila. So I can go to work. For a company that feels nothing. With people who I don't know, beside what they show me.

I don't enjoy this. I don't know what to do about that fact. I was raised by the type of people who, if there was a problem with anything, something not working right, they would fix that. Immediately. I was taught how to teach myself to fix things. How to solve problems. I've had chronic depression my entire life, and there is nothing I feel like I can do to fix this. Because my problem can't be fixed. I fucking love living. The idea of sensation, if you look at this from a universal scale, this is fucking amazing. I can think, and reason, and plan and see what happens and create and shape and view complex patterns and shapes and experience how just the simple part of hearing tones in a certain order can make the electricity in my brain do different things. And that is so special.  

And I would take all of the involuntary mood swings and voices in my head telling me I want to die, the parts of myself that will not go away I would love all of it. But I live here on this planet with people who don't see things the way I do. People who do not understand how the basic idea of cause and effect could apply to them, these people who see themselves as above everyone else because of perceived wealth or ignorance or just plan sociopathy. Culturally and socially reinforced nihilism. I don't understand how people could be so fucking arrogant. This is a beautiful, gorgeous possibility. And people ruin it. That's how I see it anyway. And I don't see any way for me to change the people, all I can do is change my own situation.

Sorry if that seems dramatic, but I'm glad to write down my thoughts. Maybe now I'll go live by a pond and write a book about it.",,Depressed

"Just need to vent.I want to die.
The people in my life wouldn't be effected by my death. 

My husband knows about my intentions. He seems alright about it. He's sitting infront of me in the living room right now playing video games while I'm ugly crying and writing this on my phone. We've talked about my kids staying with my mom if anything were to ever happen to me. Which is good, she can provide more for them and they like spending time with her better anyway. 

My mom and I don't have a relationship. We communicate about my kids, because she loves them. But I'm just a long list of disappointments. If she had the kids, there wouldn't be a reason for her to even want to contact me. If anything it would be like a weight off her shoulders if I actually were to kill myself. She hated having to pay my hospital bill from when I attempted in high school, I don't want to leave another bill for anyone again. 

My dad is remarried and doing his own thing. I talk to him a few times a week. I'm not sure he would even notice I stopped answering the phone.

I have probably 2 really close friends. But at this point in my life I can see them fighting to even want to be around me. 

Lilly is trying really hard because she may be afraid I'll actually hurt myself. But it's not fair to her anymore. I don't bring anything to our friendship anymore. I have no money to do anything anymore. My life is consumed with relationship drama with my family and husband, it's not fun talking or being around me.

Matt is in the military. He's made new friends, he's doing really well. We don't talk as often. But I think he would understand. He knows this has been an ongoing issue for me since I was a kid. 

I poison everything I touch. It's not fair to anyone that I'm like this. I don't want to hurt anyone, and I'm tired of hurting. I don't mean to be such a trash person, I don't want to be crying right now. ",,Depressed

"i'm not going to pretend this is urgenti think a lot of the posts on /r/suicidewatch are intended to convey an urgency that isn't there, and they are better categorized as cries for help or attention. i think that's fine -- most of the people who function here as suicide prevention counselors probably know this, and only resolve to help someone in pain, regardless of how real, immediate, or serious the suicide threat is. 

that said, i think about it a lot. furthermore i'm never sure if my suicidal ideadiation is more a product of the shitty circumstances in my life (middle aged, no job or career, no partner for 9 years, and mental illness/brain damage/psychological problems). 

i want desperately to be normal, to work a good job, and find a partner i love and who loves me. but i sometimes think my illness issues make those things impossible or prohibitively difficult. i come across as more intelligent and competent than i am over text because i'm a good writer (earning a living wage as a writer is a long shot), but in real life i'm strangled with anxiety and slow thinking. 

i have a suicide plan: get a 12-gauge, short-barrel shotgun with 00 buckshot shells, insert in mouth while clamping down with my teeth on the barrel padded with a washcloth, aim for the soft palate, and pull the trigger. pretty much guaranteed success there; i've done my research. it'd be as easy of driving to the sporting goods store, filling out a form, and swiping a credit card. 

i don't plan to carry out this plan now, but it's always there if things get bad enough, which they well might; i'm set to take prereqs for nursing school in the fall, and if i find i can't do it then i might just sign out, so to speak. i have no children, and as i said no partner. my parents would be devastated but they'd understand.

"Depressed/Getting My Life off my Chest Rant/Thinking of SuicideHello my name is Miss PandaPotamus,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to start but I feel like I'm at the end, in some way I feel like 'checking out early' is the only route for me. I suppose it's selfish, but this is after years of being selfless; and nothing has come of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I mean nothing I mean. I'm just an aging woman, alone with her fantasies to keep me sane.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is just to get my 'life' off my chest, romantically, family, career.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off by, I'm 32 years 'young'.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up wasn't easy, I grew up 200 miles either direction from 'civilization', one of those out in the boonies sort of towns. One gas-station, one restaurant, the rest was down to blue-collar work.

&amp;#x200B;

My father worked in the industry there, as well as my grandfather you could say that if you were born in the town, you'd end up working at the place too when you grew up. Unfortunately my father had an abusive childhood which lead him to have: Paranoid-Schizophrenia. He may have had it his whole life but wasn't 'triggered' until the 1980's during a STRIKE. My older sister, and a new baby on the way must've sent him over the edge, Dr's don't know back then no one even breathed or thought of mental-illness.

&amp;#x200B;

So I grew up, the daughter of the crazy man. Mental-illness back in those days was super hush hush. Nothing compared to now, people walk down the street and wear their illnesses like its a badge of honor. I don't understand it because of how I grew up I just know I am happy they aren't some families dirty little secret like my father was.

&amp;#x200B;

This meant I couldn't have friends. Not because I didn't WANT them or because my family didnt want me to have any just who would let their kid be friends with the crazy man of the town?

&amp;#x200B;

My closest friend other than my imagination was a girl who lived a few minutes out of town. It was my only 'normal' I had until her father blew his head off. She and her family moved. That was the last friend I had. (really I lack social skills to make them...friends...face to face)

&amp;#x200B;

Things were tough simply being that my father wasn't abusive in anyway; but my mother who totally did the house-wife thing back then was now dedicated to taking care of my father. The TV was my baby-sitter. I had my grandmother/grandfather but my grandmother favored and still favors  my well-to-do cousins (even though they never call or visit her yet I'm the one who brought her with me to the new house I just bought!!!). 

&amp;#x200B;

Before my grandfather passed he'd always tell me I was ""I was going to be the most beautiful girl ever.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still waiting for that to happen 3 decades later.

&amp;#x200B;

Things progressed with my fathers' illness, and SS/disability for a family of 4 went enough of a way to keep food on the table, the electric on and well since this was the middle of nowhere the house we lived in was one my grandfather made way back in the day. So growing up I had ALL the necessities and my family wasn't abusive like others have had to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

My family would however fight frequently and you NEVER KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, I remember I was in 3rd grade and my mother was brushing my hair for school, my father was pacing back and forth. She told him to STOP and SIT DOWN, he eventually JUMPED OUT the living room  window. He'd had a seizure, that's what the Dr's said. From there it went to him sneaking in my room at night and standing over me in the dark, calling me Satan/the Devil. To him sleeping with knives under his pillow until my graduation night.

&amp;#x200B;

The day of my graduation my father had made a cryptic phone-call to my mother who had come to pick me up from school. We got home and all the doors were locked, he'd shoved a chair against the door knob. I had to break into my own home, through the kitchen window only to crawl down over the sink onto the cement floor which was covered in blood. He'd slit his wrists and smeared the blood all over the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

For those that don't know..Blood is symbolic to majority of schizophrenics.

&amp;#x200B;

So off we go to the hospital, hours later for my graduation night I got to scrub my father's crusty blood off the floor. I don't do well in conversations returning to when I was younger, I never really had a child-hood. Like I said it all went to caring for my father in a small minded community, and I was constantly bullied.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I grew up with some fractured idea of what I should be physically,mentally and I've never recovered from that. I was picked on for anything I did, from my voice to my hair. I wanted to not exist since my grandfather passed, I only had him 6yrs, my personal cheer-leader who let me be a kid. Let me be ME was gone...after 6yrs. 

&amp;#x200B;

He let me dream, let me try my art: I used to love painting and drawing. I gave it  up eventually, my family was never interested in it, my mother never had the time and I remember vividly there was this art-gallery I'd been accepted into with my work on display, however my cousin had a spelling bee, one of many he'd done. My mother dropped me off at my art-gallery while she took herself and my grandmother to his spelling bee. I don't think they know how much that hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...Graduation day came and went. Years of not being able to sleep, a lack in myself and lack of interest from my family there I was: Graduated. No hopes, no dreams, no ideas for who or what I wanted to be when I got to this point: Everyone had laughed at anything I wanted to do. I'd say...I want to be a veterinarian and my family would laugh, my cousins with their non-crazy father who had a job and my aunt who worked, with their 3 bedroom/2 bath house could say they wanted to walk on the moon and my family would eat it up and tell them they could do/be anything!

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was NOTHING I just got hired on at the industry. Mindless blue-collar work. The pay was good of course you could 'die' any time of course they'd HAVE TO pay well (thanks unions). It let me do what young people my age couldnt: I could AFFORD to get my poverty stricken family things they never had: Good food, good clothes, vacations I'd never been on a vacation before!

&amp;#x200B;

We finally got..wait for it: THE INTERNET in my area and I think the internet has both saved my life and ruined it.

&amp;#x200B;

It started out with me going to self-esteem conventions mostly in LAS VEGAS, where I met another rather lonely girl/woman. There she introduced me to the social world of gaming: Second Life.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where it all went down the tubes, as someone who grew up with little to no people skills this was the best way to just get to KNOW someone. I worked so much and had no time that I could only manage to get on my computer and talk with perfect strangers before heading back to my boring life of work work work! (By this time I had made enough money to PRIVATELY have my father admitted to assisted living psychiatric facilities because I couldnt do it anymore nor my mother).

&amp;#x200B;

Talking to these internet people let me have...humor, they let me say things I could never say to my family, to my class-mates. 3-4 months in, I met this wonderful guy who was from Canada and we hit it off. I think for the first time I was in love, I know that sounds silly and stupid but I was. Not with pixels but to the voice/idea/thought/sight \*pictures\* of him when I came home, to someone who genuinely seemed to want to hear about my day, to know I was ok, to SPEND TIME WITH ME. I was living my fairy-tale I read about and watched romantic Princess Bride movies about.

&amp;#x200B;

He was my Wesley and I was his Buttercup and his EX and REALITY were Humperdink. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see he eventually, 6 months in asked me to come see him and a 21 yr old me said yes! I got everything set to go, but shady things had started happening because for those that dont know Second-Life. It's like a horrible SIM game with no regulations. It's a cesspit of Hell but once you're in its hard to get out.Anyway people have a tenancy to make ALTERNATE accounts, red-flags this guys EX was messaging me, telling me not to trust him (I'm sure it was him looking back) but LOVE CONQUERS ALL!

2,000 miles later August of 09 I was there in Canada, shacked up at some Best Western close to where he lived. I was excited I was going to MEET MY PRINCE CHARMING, my granfather was right I was the most beautiful girl ever, and I was going to make a family with this person. He ignored my phone-calls for 2 days, he answered on the third telling me: 

""I dont want to see you, go away, go back home"" 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd taken 2 weeks off work, I cried for a day but couldnt stay in Canada another moment I wanted to come HOME but...how could I come home just so my family could laugh at my predicament?

&amp;#x200B;

I rented a car and just drove down the east coast, Canada to Florida, hit the I-10 and took it all the way back home. 

&amp;#x200B;

SL Guy did eventually contact me, he said he had aids. I don't know a decade later if I should believe him or not.

&amp;#x200B;

After him, I became extremely cynical and I just never said NO to a relationship because they'd all become a joke to me. Real life I can touch your hand relationships were a joke, any Secondlife relationships that followed were a joke, this was my life for nearly 7 years. I knew in some way none of these men loved me like they claimed, wanted to conquer heaven and earth to be with me.....That was a fantasy I HAD to let it go!

&amp;#x200B;

Then I bought a fancy house in a city, and took my family with me, I had HIGH SPEED internet, a new gaming PC I just got and was  introduced to H1Z1. I met a group of guys that were super cool, one I totally had a crush on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2yrs later H1Z1 Crush and I hit it off. My heart let go of SL Guy and let me embrace this new one, the problem was I never knew why the other had left me, what was so horribly wrong with me? Was I ugly? Maybe I am, I know I'm not something to write home about. What was it about me that made me so unbeautiful to a dude that supposedly had aids?

&amp;#x200B;

Now here I was with H1Z1 Guy, he wasn't HOT by any means, totally a 6ft Leprechaun but I'm not superficial about ANYONE ELSE other than myself. So there I am working out, dieting, trying to find any way to physically be the most beautiful trophy girl-friend for this average Joe.

&amp;#x200B;

Then suddenly - I lost my amazing job. BOOM. DONE. GONE. 

&amp;#x200B;

H1Z1 Guy still lived at home, mommy and daddy paid for everything (I encouraged him to get a job despite his 'anxiety') but there were months that...I had only $0.99 in my account when I found a new job that paid 3/4 LESS than my previous job. This guy couldnt understand why I couldnt get a plane ticket to go see him, saving money was a struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway...fast-forward 2yrs since saying YES to a new Internet LDR I'd finally saved enough money to go see him, and put some job applications in the city near him so we could try to make US a reality. Mind-you this guy he'd lied to me several times like ie. he was home playing video games but had told me he wasnt home he was at work, instead of just saying ""hey just got home want to play with the guys for a bit xoxo love u"" , he was very controlling, jealous, never opened up to me, but I BELIEVED I could make this work even though I cried myself to sleep for almost a year and half because of this guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to meet him, 900 miles and he's sitting there treating the waitress like garbage at the restaurant we went to. He'd GHOSTED me for 2 weeks prior (he'd found himself a new e-bitch who knows how long he'd been cheating) and he WOULD NOT put down his phone. It hurt so much seeing that, after he'd ghosted me, ignored every single phone call, every text, every email but there he was not paying me the time of day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the DOOZIE  came, we'd gone to the movies, he was trying to get in my panties but I stopped him. I couldn't get intimate with someone who'd treated me like that, there were Egyptians building pyramids in my coochie when he was touching my thigh. Just. He didn't respect me enough to even seem to give two shits I was there and then he looked me in the eyes as I was bawling my eyes out as he was telling me he didnt want to be with me-  he said:

""You're not even a real person to me.""

&amp;#x200B;

That killed something inside me, I'm not sure what anymore. I know SL GUY took a chunk out of it when that happened 7yrs ago thats why it took me 7yrs to even try with H1Z1 GUY. Whatever was left was gone, in an instant. Not only had my 2yrs of struggle to make certain my family was set to come see this guy had been nothing to him, I was NOT A REAL PERSON.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a year since then. I have met someone between then and now he is a younger guy and he's super into me but I dont believe a word. It's like he's me  when I was young and in love, full of life/vibrance/HOPE and I'm the shit-lords I gave my all to and I told him my past and this new guy is adamant I'm where he wants to try and throw his life away into.

&amp;#x200B;

What he doesn't know is: I want to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I lay in bed at night since H1Z1 GUY and I want to die, I want to not wake up. I don't want to see the sun, I don't want to be me anymore. I've considered going to a shrink but lets face it thats $130-$200 a pop for an hour session to say everything that I have stated here, and maybe get a prescription of: Don't be psycho 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling that I have wasted my life, career wise, love wise, everything is whats catching me; and it hurts. Loving in this society is so painful I can't be fucked to try anymore, this disposable upgrade-only society! I want this new guy to find himself a woman that can give him everything he wants/dreams supports him when he's down. Because I was her, 1yr ago but now I'm just this bitch that barely manages to deal with basic life-functions.

&amp;#x200B;

Being unqualified to diagnose but I really do feel and WebMD feels I am suffering from depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

I look in my mirror everyday and I hate who I see, I close my eyes in a quiet empty room and I hate the person I am left with: Myself.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said I think of killing myself constantly but I wont/cant because my aging mother who dedicated her life to taking care of my father and having nothing for herself. Depends on me. My grandmother who never worked a day in her life other than full-time house-wife (which is technically a job) also depends on me. My father depends on me.

&amp;#x200B;

So I can't die, at least not yet but I just lay in bed and dream of dying, I dream of it this fantasy world that when I die there is another life and that one will be better. But what if this is the only shot I have and its already half over?

&amp;#x200B;

I work in a new career field where life and death are a constant; and I know certainly my life isnt at all that hard in comparison to others however I'm not trying to win a 'My life was shittier than yours"" contest. My life simply up to this point has been hard enough FOR ME and now I can't seem to shake that feeling of...this world is better off with one less waste of time/space as myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh well we'll see.....

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading Reddit just had to get my life off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has kicked me out of his house after I dropped out of school, my siblings resent me and barely interact with me, my brother bullied me for years because me being suicidal meant he had to go to family therapy like 10 times over the course of half a year and because I required a lot of support and attention.

"The love of my life has left me and I spend every day wandering aimlessly in my own home..I'm only 16. I don't connect to people. Not because I'm awkward, I'm actually quite outgoing, I just don't connect emotionally to people. Few months ago I met a girl who I've connected to more than anyone else. In a way I never thought I could. I fell in love. Best part was that she loved me back. More than she probably should have. She struggled with depression and I actually saved her life twice.. We were madly in love and I believe we still are.. But it ended because she has issues she feels she needs to deal with alone. 


 Anyway I've always felt so alone in life. Like I've always just dragged through days aimlessly. I hated going to bed. I felt like I didn't anyone to say goodnight to or anything to look forward to come morning. Well when I was with her I never felt like I had to. She was there to say goodnight and there in the morning. I was genuinely happy. Sadly though.. In the last few weeks we were together she became less and less happy. She eventually broke up with me. She says she needs to work on herself and work through her issues alone. We tried again for about a week though. Then she broke it off for good. She use to tell me I was what made her happy. That I was perfect. I told her the same thing. It was forever and always for us.. Ever since she's broken up with me, my anxiety has been extremely bad. I've been having alot more panic attacks. For example I had 4 in one evening
I don't want to sleep because I only dream of her being there with me again. If I do sleep it's not for long.. When I'm awake I can only think about her and our time together.


I don't enjoy anything. I can't even distract myself just to keep my mind off things. I only think of her and how she made me feel. This isn't JUST a breakup.. It's a huge part of me that's gone. I gave everything I am and was into her because she did the same for me. I spend my time at home wandering from room to room occasionally checking my phone.. Noone knows but I've cut myself a few times to see if I have any feeling, I've played with matches and I'd put the ashes on my hands. I started drinking. I'm not proud of anything I've done.. I'm scared to be alone. Thoughts shoot through my head saying it wouldn't matter if I didn't make it to tomorrow. Right? I mean I've got nothing waiting for me in the mornings.. The only reason I haven't considered letting go so far is because I keep waiting for her.. (She said it's still forever and always) I'm not sure what to do with myself. I have become the nothing I've always feared.. I'm so scared of myself and being completely alone again..",,Depressed

"Venting. Not quite sure what the sub is about I didnt read much of the about, there wasnt much from what I saw thoughI dont really feel anything anymore. I relapsed on heroin, partly because even sober and trying to get a life back that I'm not sure I had, I still didnt feel anything. The woman I was starting to be involved with I no longer have feelings about automatically, my friends I dont feel like talking to. I lay in bed often most hours of the day staring at the ceiling. Mostly the only thing I do is make my moves to cop smack and then lock myself back in my room. I've made mistakes with my family recently because of my addiction and lack of self control, but the shitty part is (which they of course refuse to admit any of their faults or wrongdoings) when I was sober and at least carrying my weight since I had to move back home, I was spoken to and treated not much differently than I am when I'm fucking up. I very nearly took a trazodone and a few sleeping pills after shooting up the other night and slept on my back porch to induce hypothermia and not wake up. I dont often get close enough to doing anything, but I consistently romanticize dying or self endangerment. A large reason I use, as it developed more recently in my last two relapses, is the solace in the fact that I might die anytime I use. I'm the only person i know that shoots up that has no qualms doing it alone without anyone there to narcan me. I dont feel anything for life anymore. I used to be so bright and happy, I used to have dreams, passions and loves, I used to love my friends and family and myself. Even when using before, I still had a fire in me to chase something more out of life. I've talked to professionals, I've been to rehabs, but at this point I feel as though all is lost, and that I never had much of a life or a track for me to get back on. I keep having recurring dreams, which is weird in the first place because mostly heroin users dont dream, that are depressing, and even worse of my dreams is that the love of my life that I wasted and lost years ago, I finally felt as though I got over her and now I dream about her constantly and I dont know why. That hurts a lot. My love for music and writing and art deteriorated.  I just dont know anymore. I feel broken. I dont want people to tell me its okay to do it, but I also hate the predictable and stereotypical ""it gets better, you dont have to do this, your family loves you"" type stuff to veer people away from suicidal ideology. I wish I felt anything anymore. When my parents fight with me i dont even have the energy to care and either calm it down or fight back. I don't often find myself smiling naturally at all anymore. I could probably keep going, but I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. I'm a 25 year old Male. I've lost and sacrificed everything I was and had. I dont see the point of it all when i die and it vanishes as though we were never here anyway, and again I'm not so certain i had a life or track in the first place for me to get back on. I dont know what to expect in responses from people, and I dont know if I necessarily want any or that it will change anything. But I dont have anyone I feel like talking to, hell, anyone to talk to in life right now, so venting to strangers felt like a good idea.

"I'm not at risk I have a questionI recently met a girl on an app like tinder geared towards people under 18. I wasn't using it as a platform to get with girls I was using it to get to know people around the country and what life is like there. One girl I had a nice conversation about hockey with and she said she wanted to add me on Snapchat. That was a few days ago and she texted me tonight saying she was sad and explained how she felt worthless and already tried suicide. I did everything I could to calm her down and get her to not harm herself. After sending her the suicide hotline number and suggesting she call it she became very angry with me. She told me that a boy she met called her a waste of space and that she ""has a blade"" I tried getting her to calm down and did everything I could to keep a conversation with her but she blocked me. I'm concerned deeply about her. I don't know if I'll ever find out if she is ok or not. If she does do you think I'd find out through police going through her Snapchat and finding our texts?

"I'm lost, I don't think I fit in anywhere in this lifeI (32/f) have been self harming and thoughts of suicide come and go but this morning on the way to work, so persistent that I'm not sure what to do. I have a very loving and supportive partner, but I frequently go to them for help and fear that by leaning on them heavily I am emotionally abusing them. They have their own life to attend to and can't 'treat' me - I see a therapist too, once a week but it's not been enough.

3 years ago I finished grad school and have not been able to find full time work in my field. I left a full time job I hated, which paid well and had fantastic benefits, in order to pursue that degree. I performed well (so I thought?) but despite applying to jobs like crazy, I have had interviews and sometimes second interviews, but never a hire. The pummeling of rejection have led me to believe that there is something inherently wrong with me, that I am unacceptable, and that informs my poor performance in future job interviews, which causes me to continue to not receive offers. I'm paralyzed as to what to do next, because I feel every decision I have made in the past has led me to my current failure and that I can't trust myself to make a good decision, so I'm just stuck in this cycle.

I do work, but I'm miserable in my job. It's in my field, but part time and for most of the day I just sit here, which leads me to dwell on my failures.

I also don't want to have children and have never planned on a family. I've always planned to be this highly creative and independent career woman. Which is not happening. The only other path I ever see is women pouring their time and energy into a family - which I don't want. So I'm left with...just being a failure at my career, and I have nothing else. If I'm not a career woman or a mom, what the hell am I doing? Where do I even fit in?

The fact that I have two degrees but still no desirable skills which means no job offers forces me to believe that the problem is me, I am inherently wrong, unacceptable, unfixable. So my choice is to continue living this apologetic, pathetic existence, or I just let go and end it. I don't know what to do.",,Depressed

"My struggle with suicide an the people I hateBTW this is a copy of my first post the original one which is basically the same and its at r/depression.Two years ago I was in a class and I have a deep love of art an it was an art class so I thought I would love it but that was going to change my life forever. Was it for good? Was it for bad? I guess I'll just have to wait and see. I was never exactly know for being cool or relevant in any sort of way because my parents were very sheltering but I thought nothing of it and I was just me, regular me. But anyway it was just after Christmas break and I was happy because I had an art class and so I was in a class with a very nice teacher and I sat with two other people. Little did I know that they would ruin my life. That was the year I no longer was the smart guy or even the artistic guy, no, now I was the loser, the idiot, the moron, the retard, the motherfucker who messes up everything. Literally everyday they told me that I was no good, that I was and idiot, they said I couldn't do anything right I had no friends to turn to they all called me stupid too. They became distant and I didn't seem to be in the conversations anymore it seemed like everyone was learning new stuff. Before that year I got very good grades and then SHE happened her name was Maria she was one of the people sitting next to me in art and I hate her with every part of my being even to this day. She called me an idiot and made fun of me in Spanish just so I would not understand and get mad she said that nobody liked me and she said that I was worthless and I was too stupid to be there. This is went on for the rest of the year and plunged me into a depression where deep is not even able to begin to describe how bad it was. Every aching moment was like he'll for me as I both Maria and my thoughts killed and rotted me from the inside out. I wanted to kill myself and still do today sometimes I even asked my brother what would be the best way to kill a person by stabbing them in the neck because I wanted to be prepared just in case I hit rock bottom. Because of her insults and everybody else's insults to this I still feel out of place and it still seems like every step I take is in the wrong way no matter what  every time I try to do what others do they just laugh at me like I'm some cheap knockoff. I basically signed a contract with myself that changed the way I looked and the way I talked and interacted basically turning me into a big jerk who wanted so desperately to fit in and be accepted. Lots of days an nights I would set up a noose in my room and stare at it thinking of all the horrible things and wondering if today was going to be the day that I actually kill myself. I sort of turned into a nihilist so my gf broke up with me which didn't help and I spiraled further and further into depression while people were calling my new style from my personal contract the only thing was is that once I changed myself I couldn't go back to my old self. One day I had had enough of this pain and I put up that noose and got a chair and fastened it onto my neck then I heard my mom coming up to check on me and I didn't want her to stop me so I took the noose and threw it under my bed. Finally the year ended and I thought I had made it and in a way I had. I had gotten out of the clutches of Maria's tormenting and I started the next year I still had so much hurt and pain and scars I had new friends and there was one his name is C (not his real name just don't want to give any hints just in case anyone I know is seeing this) and I thought he was my savior and the one who would  pull me out of this depression so I started sitting at his table, I was not accepted in the slightest  everyday I was told I didn't belong there and they questioned why I sat there and they told me I wasn't wanted none of my friends would listen to me and even if they did they would just make fun of what I said because they wouldn't let me into their conversations so it felt like I was damned to not being part of it because I couldn't know what they were talking about because they wouldn't tell me. There were entire days I would go without speaking because I thought I couldn't say anything that would matter. That's basically what happened that year unacceptable depression and damnation into irrelevance. At the beginning of this year it just got worse C started being worse and worse and Hello made fun of me for things I liked and how I acted and said that I was stupid and Hello went from my idol to my enemy but Hello didnt even notice when I stopped talking to him. I began to isolate myself to see if anybody would notice and come to help me or see what was wrong... They didn't  they just kept on walking. I decided to confront Maria about what she did to me and she said Hello can't remember what she did and she doesn't care any way. These days I go through periods of madness and blind fury where I just want to kill her (of course I'd never do that) and I would scratch myself and bang my head against the wall and hit myself trying to cause myself damage because I'm a horrible disgusting ugly and annoying human being and I don't deserve the rights that others have. I did end up telling C what happened and he said he was so sorry and that he'll make everything right again but he just still ignores me though I have a new friend now L who is awesome and nobody knows this but I'm just counting down the time where I'm going to snap and probably kill myself who knows I might make it I might not. Anyway this is not the entire story with all the detail- that would be very long but I just wanted to put this out there and say to any of the others who feel insignificant and stupid and worthless and say that you're not alone.

"Abadoning my best friend over his depression...There's alot to cover but i'll try to summarize it clearly.

For years now, my mate has been battling depression. I've known him for 10+ years but I couldn't say how long for. He's always having anxiety issues and emotional rollercoasters everyday. In the past, i've happily put the efffort in to help improve his well-being, health, mentality and life overall. As I care about him, of course.

However, time and time again, I have given him advice and options for him to take to help improve his situation, and he has ignored it. I understand that advice is advice though, and I don't expect him to follow it to a T. But instead, it feels like i've wasted my time talking to a brick wall. Because he reverts back to his old self shortly after making some life improving decisions.

Now, this is an issue as not only has the depression got a hold of my mate, but he has also become quite a toxic person to anyone close to him. He consistently pushes himself into online 'relationships' that fall through within months or a year, and will shove his close friends aside to make it work. In the past he has blatantly ignored or insulted one of his other best mates because he can't control his moods. Now that guy hates him for it.

My mate doesn't see what he has done to the people that care about him. These relationships, they bring out the worst in him as he uses people (including myself) as a backup to reach out to for comfort or company when he's current flirt is busy. I'll be playing games with him or on the phone then he'll say ""I've got to go"" or something similar and become secretive about it (I believe it's because i've had words about him forcing online relationships).

This year he met with this girl he'd been in a 'relationship' with for the past year or so. Turns out, things went south quite quickly. As they met, it became awkward for the girl and she was uncomfortable to be with him, or seen holding hands. He had told me how much they both 'loved' each other and wanted a life with each other. Well, the day after they met she blocked him on all platforms and told him 'we should see other people'. 

Am I wrong for not feeling sympathetic for him when this happened? I could comfortably say i'm an honest, kind hearted, selfless guy and I do have empathy for others. But when I found out, I had no reaction. Because I expected it, all of his friends did. He then became a wreck and went to the bottle. Now he's currently -and secretely- talking up another girl and it's been less than a few months...

The problem I face is that I care so much for my friend, and I want the best for him, but through my experience in life I've found that you can't help someone who isn't willing to help themself. 

We are so alike and get along so well, it's saddening to see things go like this. Since these past months, he has tried again to talk to me and repeat this cycle. I feel shitty about it, but i've been ignoring him or replying bluntly. I'm conflicted, as I have actually been losing sleep thinking about him and his situation. I wish it were better for him and thus for us, as I feel i'm his only true friend he has left.

Aswell as all these problems, he's also been on suicide watch for the past year or so. The last thing I ever want for him is to do something awful as that. I want to help him, but I don't want him to loop into the same cycle he's got himself into. I know this isn't about me and much more of an internal struggle for him, but it's now affecting my life more than ever. I no longer idly sit by and shrug off or repress obvious outrages and disrespect from him. Hence why i'm reaching out to more people, first my close family and friends, now anyone who could share some advice.

Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read my current situation. I'd greatly apprectiate any feedback and advice for what to do. I've come to realise the importance of opening up and getting a 'rant' out, that's why I needed to express all this.
I know in my heart I want to help him and continue to advise him. But my mind tells me to leave and distance myself from him, much like all his friends have already done.

Am I right in how I've acted?

3. Will any bills be covered by insurance?

"People have a choice about whether or not they want to live and they should not be made to feel guilty or obligated to stay alive.One of the things I liked best about this forum was I felt like it wasn’t people seeking pity or trying to shove bullshit advice down people’s throats but I’m seeing more and more of those kind of posts in this forum. No hate on people who are seeking support good on you this is a great place to get that just not what I’m here for. 

Life is shitty. Everyone always says “it’ll get better” and I know it will; it’ll get better for short periods of time then it’ll all come crashing down again and I’ll be back in the same default I’m always in. Suffering pure suffering. Life is a curse not a gift especially for people with mental illness. When I lose a friendship or relationship it sucks. I can’t form connection like normal people and I genuinely will not find people I connect with like that ever again. I take loss so hard and life is so much loss which is one of the main reasons I’m not meant to live. 

I’m depressed as fuck I have been since I was 8. I’ve tried many different methods to help myself and none of them work. Medication makes me feel like a zombie, I’ve been able to put smart every therapist I’ve ever been too, and I’m not self disciplined enough to keep myself on track. I bring my friends down as they are my only support and that’s extremely unfair to them. I burden everyone because I can’t function like a regular fucking person. 

I don’t care about my life at all. The main reason I’ve made it this is far is living for other people and nearly all the people I was living for don’t want or need me anymore leaving me to try to make meaning out of my own life through goals or something like that, but I genuinely do not give a fuck about myself. Nothing brings me joy or excites me and I don’t care enough to create and work towards goals for myself. 

In summary everyone in my life is better ofc without me. I don’t want to live I believe life is shitty and nobody can actually disagree with me on that. The biggest fear holding me back is the fear of failing and being left with severe brain damage.

"it was my birthday yesterday and all i've done is research how to do it properlyI wrote out a draft this morning at 4am to post because I couldn't sleep but I deleted it. Some part of me wants attention, wants someone to care, but I also don't trust opening up to people and have them think I'm weak and pathetic. I don't even know what to say or where to start. I never do. That's probably why I'm unable to even submit assignments for uni and end up failing. I just simply do not know. Even though yesterday was my birthday I spent it all wanting to die and researching how to kill myself properly. Even the one thing I thought might make it good turned out just like I feared it would. Nobody cared really; I can count the people on my hand who said happy birthday to me. I'm sure half only did so because they were coerced or something like my brother and because it was strange that a person I hadn't spoken to in a year and hadn't cared to say happy birthday to me last year, suddenly texted me out of the blue to say happy birthday. I was gonna just throw myself off a building but that doesn't seem very viable so I will just hang myself instead I think. Today I was testing putting pressure on my throat, first with my hands then with a belt. You see, I don't do this on impulse. I plan things out so it won't fail, I won't do this without knowing it's very unlikely I will mess up and fail. I was holding on until after my birthday to do it (bc of said thing I mentioned before) and I'm not even interested in anything anymore, not even the one thing that was giving me artificial serotonin or whatever so I kept living but now there is not a single difference between me sitting in bed all day, scrolling pages endlessly just to do something vs being dead. I can't imagine myself living past 20. Tomorrow I might just try to find some rope and practice with that, or I need to buy some but I can barely even make myself get out of bed and can't even take care of myself so I don't know how I will manage to. I don't even feel like eating and when I do eat I feel sick. I feel like my body wants me to die, just like my head wants me to so badly. 

I know nobody will probably even read this, and if they do they'll leave generic comments telling me not to kill myself, that they 'care' and 'love' me which only make me want to do it more. I do not like it when people pretend to care. i'll probably delete this anyway bc i know nobody cares really :)",,Depressed

""congrats! youve lived xxx amount of years! just wait till you xxx when you grow old and die!"". and thats if i somehow manage to get that far without something causing my untimely demise. id welcome it if it werent for the fact that every way i go would likely be painful if its health related, and much worse if it has to do with my living arrangement which surely wont last forever. whod want to take care of a autistic, sexual deviant, man-child? it only makes me a burden. either i end up never living with my SO and continue painfully living with my mother till she dies and then end up dying on the streets or something, or, i live with my SO causing them more stress then they deserve, more strain on them finacially while they take care of their own family on top of me. the might even kill themselves leaving me to bear the pain of losing them as well. i want them happy, but theres nothing i can do. i cant even make myself happy. though they said it in stress as i was trying to comfort them, i believe its completely true.

"You asked out your crush? Well, I never had one! Since this sub has a thing for talking about crushes and being romantic and whatnot, why not do the opposite and talk about being aromantic? 

Hi, I'm 19 and I'm an aromantic heterosexual (*technically* LGBT I suppose) male.

Growing up, I was always repulsed by the idea of romance. I didn't really have the feels for anyone. Whenever I was asked if I liked anyone, I would respond with ""No"", thinking it was a joke question made to make me look bad. If I was asked out, I would always assumed it was joke or a set-up to make fun of me. I just didn't like anyone in that way. I never had any romantic crushes, and unlike most teenagers, I never had thoughts of girls or finding a girlfriend; I was more interested in my own interests, like video games or drawing and whatnot. I had always assumed that no one actually falls in love and that it was just some form of comedy or a schtick or something, but that changed when I entered high school in 2015.

In high school, I noticed that virtually everyone had a significant other. Almost everyone I knew had a partner of some sort. I even assumed everyone in my high school was ""lovesick"" or something. That's when I finally realized that people actually take relationships seriously. Then the pressure really began; I was constantly asked if I had a girlfriend or not, of course I would answer ""No"". Unfortunately, homophobia ran rampant in high school, and I'm pretty sure those questions were asked to weed out any homosexual students to pick on them. (Yes, a lot of people in my high school thought I was gay, most likely because I wasn't interested in finding a girlfriend. This had led to me getting picked on quite a bit.) I then began the search for a girlfriend sometime in 10th grade (2016-2017) out of peer pressure, but with no success. Of course I was getting frustrated from not being able to find a girlfriend, not because I wanted romance, but because I felt left out, as again - everyone in my high school had a significant other and I felt left out (also my heterosexual desires started showing up, heh heh...), and yeah, that was a rough time to say the least.

I then did get a girlfriend in 11th grade (2017), and well honestly, I thought it was supposed to feel different from having a regular friend, but no, it felt exactly the same, except with hugging and kissing. But to be honest, I didn't really care about doing romantic stuff with her (I hated dating or having to say romantic compliments), like I said, I had my own interests. Whenever she showed up to my house, I felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention as I should be giving to her, but I didn't know what to do. She was just there, y'know?

Then I was researching asexuality sometime in the spring of 2020, and discovered that you could have a sexual orientation and a romantic orientation. Initially, I thought romantic attraction was just ""hmm, that person looks nice and they seem pretty friendly. I wanna be with this person and maybe hug them"", but as it turns out, I was WAY off. What I described was strong platonic (and maybe partially sensual) attraction. I maybe aro, but I still experience sexual attraction, and from what I found out later on, romantic attraction is basically the same as sexual attraction, but only with dating and romance instead of sex. In a technical sense, romantic attraction is a chemical release from the brain (learned that from the comments section of an aromantic subreddit) and it's a compulsory desire, like you just got to have it!  Because of what I initially believed romantic attraction was, I identified as a ""biromantic heterosexual"" for a few months because I viewed men and women equally romantically (or so I thought). It was only a while ago that I found out was romantic attraction ACTUALLY meant, and that really challenged what I believed was ""romantic attraction"", as I never felt the urge to be with anyone in a romantic sense or to go out and seek a date. I even feel like I could go my entire life without romance. 

I thought I had experienced crushes, but turns out, those were ""squishes"", which are ""platonic crushes"" if you will. My ""crushes"" were ""out of sight, out of mind""; once that person was out of my sight, they were out of my mind, but apparently real crushes don't work like that. From what I was able to gather, with real romantic crushes, that person would stay in your mind, even long after they've left your sight. The romantic desire for that person is just stuck in your head, and you're just immensely, but involuntarily, thinking about them... and you just can't kick those thoughts away. You have thoughts, hoping that they'll ask you out, talk to you, or even wave back You might even feel ""lovesick"", hoping to see them again. It's almost as if you're obsessed with that one person. Basically, imagine having a song stuck in your head, but amplified by 10 times, and you have the desire to meet whoever wrote that song . That's supposedly the intensity of a crush. To me, crushes sound scary. Like I can't imagine having a person stuck in my head and wanting to live my life with. 

To end this post of, I found out I was aro after realizing the love I had felt towards my girlfriend felt exactly the same as the love I had for my mother; all platonic, and recounting my past ""opinions"" on romance. But yeah, I guess I'll never experience a true crush on someone.  

I have a few questions, since I want to know for myself.

1. Were you ever repulsed by romance or love growing up?
2. Was my description of what a crush is accurate?
3. Do you think you can go your whole life without a romantic partner?

To conclude the story, it's perfectly fine if you don't ever want to date someone. Live your life however you see fit!",,Stressed

"I am not really good with titles but ye, I just really wanted to talk about some things I have had in my mind for a long time. Well I have been having many thoughts for quite some time and I don't really know how I am supposed to feel. Also, excuse me if I have any typos but my hands are cold rn because I had to go and buy milk and I am not really in the mood to read what I have written after I have wrote it.

Anyways, a year ago and more I used to want and kill myself or just leave everything behind and Runaway from my home. Mostly the 2nd thing tho because I do kinda value my life. I don't think that I ever got friends I could trust with everything. Sure, when there's a fight going on they will come to help me the same way I do but I never really wanted to talk about my personal life with people I call close friends. And the first time I got a friend I could trust was like on Fabruary 2020 when one of my friends asked for my advise to sell weed.

The relationship I have with my biological father is complicated, I like him but I don't think that if I try I can have a normal father-son relationship with him but there are many things preventing this from happening. He is a great dude but I also live in a neighbouring country so I see him and his relationship with my mother isn't great either. 

The relationship I have with my step dad (my mother divorced him like 10 months ago tho) is great? I guess, I call him dad (because I great up with him for 8-9 years from the age of 5-6 to 14). I won't say that he is a good person because he used my mother to get her in a program so that he can get the money and pay off some shit for his ex wife causing my mother to not be able to get a full time job for the next like 10 years (this happened like 7 years ago or something if I am not mistaken, the work my mother has rn is basically illegal after a certain time of the year). I do try to keep a relationship with him and would usually see him once every week if it wasn't for this quarantine shit tho. 


The relationship I have with my mother is the most complicated out of all, sure I have had fights with my step dad (I don't remember ever getting in a fight with my biological dad because I don't see him so much except summer for 2-3 months so ye...) but the fights I have had with my mother especially like a year and more ago happened like once every week for various things. Sure, she used to have many psychological problems because of her work and her relationship with my step dad since they were going to divorce sooner or later but she was taking it out on me for not having good grades and cleaning the dishes and such things. I remember one time it got physical and she scratched me with her nails and I just pushed her back on her bed (which was right below mine, I didn't have personal space until like a few months ago so would sit in the living room either alone or with my step father) and she proceeded to have a panic attack and then my grandmother started calling me swearing at me and telling me how awful I am and then telling me to take care of my mother (which I did). 

I remember when my mother saw the shit from self harm in my arm her first reaction was to tell me that if I didn't tell her what it was for she was going to tell my grandmother and then everyone in the family would know and tbh I didn't and still don't want anyone to know about that and its the first time I talk about it if I am not mistaken. I ended up making up some shit about wanting to know how it feels or some shit and she probably believed it. 

She has also told me that I was an accident and she would also get mixed up with the bullying problems when I told her not to do anything because she would make things worse (I would basically get beaten up by 3+ dudes. Sometimes it would even be 7 or more when I was in 7th grade, now in 9th grade no one even dates to touch me tho but that's another story, at least I solved that problem). 

And last but not least she has a problem with me being a little bit more introverted (even tho I have a nice social life) and when I asked her a year ago if I can go to a therapist she told me that I have no problems and that she is the one with the problems. Something I forgot to add is that she doesn't want black people close to her and also she doesn't want lgbt people close to her. I am not black nor am I from the lgbt and I don't really care about the movement but I have had some doubts about me being bi but I am not sure. 

Anyways, enough about my mother, I am not an angel either. Years ago I remember I was in some kind of stupid argument with her and told her that she probably didn't want me. (I guess I wasn't exactly wrong in that one tho) but it is still a bad thing to say to parent. 

Untill 6th grade I would be a great student after that until now I am mediocre-good or decent and ye, it's not like I am stupid I just don't study because I don't really know. I guess I don't like working hard. 

Also I have never really been able to support her emotionally (she hasn't done that either but whatever) I am just not the type of person to support others and also I. Was a fucking child, a parent shouldn't expected emotional support from their child. 

Anyways, I think I have many great friends actually tbh and that's one of the reasons I don't get into unfair fights rn. I am really trying and struggling to work on my grades and myself in general but I don't really know if I am doing it right or not. It's really complicated. 

Idk what the purpose of this post really is, probably to talk about my life a little bit? I guess? I kinda feel like I died now I would be forgotten in a few years tbh and that's probably true.

I get to project into the mc when I read and/or watch a show, I'm thinking about someone else when I draw, and most of the characters like me when I play games. Whenever I stop doing them I get upset and can't do much for a while. I don't think it's too unhealthy yet (the most hours I spend on something is 1-7 hours a day) but, there's really nothing for me outside of them. Funny thing is, I can't even tell you if I genuinely enough them. I just do them to survive. I'd die if I lost even one of these hobbies.

My only two friends are constantly busy too. I don't blame them and me feeling this way is definitely not their fault, it just kind of sucks. They told me themselves that they do like talking to me, it's just not too often. Plus they're always doing something else when they talk to me so it's not really for long.

I could drone on and on about school, my past, my family etc. etc. but you'd still get the same point I'm trying to make. I just don't feel like there's much reason to stick around. I swear I'm trying my best but it's never good enough for anyone. I think I just make them more disappointed in me anyways.

Not to mention that I keep getting this one scene in my mind that gets more vivid every day. I see myself bleeding out in my neighborhood, with a handful of knives jabbed into my stomach by myself. I'm all alone at I think in 1am or 2am, in a big puddle of blood, with a smile on my face. Each day I'm more tempted to do exactly that.

Now, it's not any easy thought I have, it's even less easier to do because I can't help shake this image of, my two friends getting really upset when they hear I died, out of my head. One of them is so vivid and feels so real when I see her cry that I almost or even do start crying with her.

I just don't know anymore. I hate living and my life really is meaningless. All I'm doing is just stealing a better person's place, when I know me dying by suicide is inevitable. I just don't want to hurt them. I don't have the resources to go away for a while so before I do it so, living is the only thing I can do to protect them.

I don't think tonight is night I do it but, I just can't keep on living. Especially when I know that most of the people around are probably hoping to hear that I died. I just care more about my two friends being upset more then them.

I really just don't know.",,Depressed

"I now hate my MAPEH Teacher. First Impressions are kind of important to me. For this school year, my mom made me change schools since I was in the same school for five years. Since I'm now in a public school, classes start on Oct. 5. My subject teachers started their meetings and everything was going well, until. It was my MAPEH Teacher's time to start a meeting. It was kinda sudden. The day before the meeting, he informed all of us about the meeting starts at 1 PM and everyone should get ready.

So the meeting starts. Like every teacher, they start their speech with a simple greeting.

""Hi, my name is [INSERT TEACHER'S NAME] and I will be your [INSERT SUBJECT] teacher. I hope you will be-"" and other kinds of nonsense.

This guy. He tells us his name, he tells us everything we should know.

MAPEH means Music, Art, Physical Education, and Health.

When he comes to the discussion of PE, that's when everything went downhill. He then started to comment on everyone's physical health. How we exercise, our weight, our diet, our weight, basically he started shaming. 

I was very insecure about my weight and this guy. THIS GUY commented on my weight. I then turned off my camera and THIS GUY keeps commenting. He then turned to the Health section AND GUESS WHAT. HE USED ME AS AN EXAMPLE. At the end of the meeting, It was time to leave. Normally, I would say thank you and gold afternoon before leaving, but this was different. This guy was different from other teachers. I don't even care if this guy was conscious for my health, THIS FUCKER BASICALLY TAUNTED MY WEIGHT. And the most frustrating of all, before I left, he said, ""Good talking to you"" to me. I say, ""You too, sir."" AND THEN HE FUCKING SAID. ""Do YoU wAnT a BuRgEr?""

The problem with this is that if they get what they want, and the at-school mask mandate is removed, the school can only go to distance learning again, which for anyone who has had that knows that you can barely learn doing it.

I personally have no problem with the masks. I've never been ""suffocated"" by them; I've never thought that they infringe on my rights. It's better where I live because we don't have a public mask mandate, so we don't have to wear one 24/7 (except if the store or resteraunt has a mandate).

"Two monthsMy son died two months ago today. His white trash grandfather ignored our rules and was negligent, killing him with his carelessness. My son was transported via helicopter,  but his mother and I beat him to the hospital (we were both at work.) 

I then watched as a dozen people took turns performing cpr on my son's limp body. They wouldn't let us into the room at first. I couldn't see how bad the damage was to his head. I thought he might have a chance. I kept thinking that ww can deal with brain damage as long he stays with us. 

Then I saw him up close. I saw that he nevery had a chance. The cpr was for our sake, not his. It was clear to a layman that he never had a chance at survival. They wanted us to know thatthey tried to save him. 

I often find my self reliving that day suddenly. The things that set it off are strange and nonsensical, at times. His grandfather showed up to the funeral unwelcome. He was told by several messengers not to come. I wish I had brought a gun for just in case, but I thought that at least his family would respect our wishes and keep him from oming. No, they rode together. 

I miss my son. The whole world seems to be ending and I hate it. I hate every day. Corrupt politicians and antimask pieces f shit. I am infuriated by the world and at the same time calmed by it.

I'm reliving all of this and so upset there are no words for it. I feel so bad for my bf who i cant even hug bc my family has to quarantine (my dad works in a nursing home with active rona cases, we're not sick but are just being safe), and that he had to deal with that, because he absolutely adores cats and owns 3 as well.

"Pushed Away the Only Thing That Matters and Now I Can’t LiveI’ve always been scared of love and finally put myself out there with a girl who was absolutely amazing. We dated for nearly two years, but I was scared as I kept falling harder and harder for her and self sabotaged and ultimately broke up with her. I left for a month on the road and we talked every day, I couldn’t get her off my mind and still am madly in love but came back to finding out she’s sleeping with someone else and doesn’t know what she wants anymore. We’ve been talking and trying to figure things out but last night I rashly decided to buy flowers to bring over to hers. She kept saying it was okay but just seemed so distant the entire time. The whole exchange ended up with us kissing and it felt distant again, with her not seeming to care at all for me anymore. I went home after to open a bottle of pills and swing it down with rum but my roommate came upstairs to find me and stopped me. At this point I don’t know what to do, I know it’s cliche being so fucked up over a girl but since leaving her nothing has felt the same. My friends, my hobbies, my every day life all feel hollow and like I’m passing thru the motions without any real purpose anymore. She was the one thing that distracted me from my depression and anxieties ever in my life but now that I think she’s gone and happy with someone else I just don’t care to be here anymore... it’s selfish and dumb but I want to die without her in every physical sense.",,Depressed

"i tried and i'll never be good enoughI can't quit punching things.. I am so angry.. and yet I am so sad.. I feel frustrated because I can't change my life.. I'm dealing with problems that people dealt with in high school because I went straight to college and focused on the schoolwork rather than much else.. I feel sick to my stomach when I hear my mother moaning in her sleep.. The doctor prescribed me a medicine to take in the morning.. but my sleep schedule is so fucked up I can't stay awake during the day and I can't sleep at night.. The only thing I do when I get out of bed is eat and try to watch something funny to make me laugh so I don't cry all the time.. I don't even feel like brushing my teeth.. and now looking in the mirror it looks like I have a gum infection and maybe an abscess.. My mother won't take me to the dentist because I don't brush my teeth enough.. I wanted the HPV vaccine, but my mother is putting that off too.. Because she wants to save money.. How could I even use the free/cheap clinic if I already have health insurance but no money to pay them (because mother has a deductible).. plus mother will find out and bully me until she gets an answer? She bullies me and if I stand up to her she fucks with my mind and tells me that I bully her.. She's threatened to put a camera in the shower.. She's told me that I must be hearing things when I had proof that I wasn't...  She thinks that because I depend on her for shelter, food, and clothing that it must be a free pass to treat me like this.. And my psychiatrist says all I really need is a job.. and I can leave my life behind.. but no, I have to go through the rest of this.. Everyone thinks they have it the same way when they say ""I'm out of work too."" No they don't.. I've been looking for work on and off from 2008-2010. I was looking for work as much as I could since the end of 2010 when I graduated from college.. I'm autistic.. Even in a good economy I might not be able to get a job.. And so I'm left just like all the other high functioning autistic adults who can't get jobs.. Living with their parent.. Except I have to live here every single day with my emotionally abusive mother.. I'll never get out.. I already tried once and it was a failure.. I have nowhere else to go.. Even if I did, I doubt anybody would be competent enough to believe me.. because nobody did for 25 years.. I go to my therapist.. but therapy is supposed to change the person using the service.. It doesn't change other people.. All I need is a job that I'll never get.. And even if I could, I seem to be too dumb now anyway.. I was wasted talent.. I would have been the most dedicated, loyal employee.. Now I'm just a 200 pound piece of shit who will never do anything right.. and since I can't now, that probably means I never have.. I'll never be okay again.. My birth was my death sentence.. But government college grants.. this is where your taxpayer dollars are going.. they spend money on students.. who never get to be employed even in a minimum wage job.. Judge me.. hate me.. Show me tough love just like everyone I've ever known in person has.. Nobody wants me.. I'll be a virgin forever.. and yet I'm scared of getting an STD.. I hate myself.. I have since I was a child.. I fit the signs of emotional abuse but who really cares.. because it will go on forever.. I talk about it here, but I can't in person.. I know that I need to get out.. but I can't.. because I'm not brave enough.. It feels easier to die than it is to be bullied to the point where I can't keep anything to myself and feel extremely helpless because of it.. My life won't change even as much as I've tried... just hurt me too... tell me to shut up.. break my heart.. i'm not sure people can be real if they don't...",,Depressed

"Urgent: how do I text acquaintances/friends after a long time? Help me catch up with some old acquaintances/friends please. This a serious post.

I’ve been stuck at college for a year and haven’t been in contact with a lot of people from school who I used to hang out with. Never really had too many friends or any if you take away childhood friends. Suffered and still suffering from severe social anxiety and don’t know how to approach them. This is the second time i’m catching up as there was a brief 3 month period when we weren’t in touch either. I know I generally get invited when they know i’m in town (sometimes to catch up / sometimes because they feel bad for me having known me for nearly my whole life and discluding me- i never truly know). 

So I really don’t know how to approach them anymore. I’m 19M and really don’t know how to text them. Last time I just let them do the talking but I forgot how it went. Last time I only messaged my closest acquaintances and then they just helped me meet everyone, even taking a vacation with them at the end. This time I really need to reduce the awkwardness and need to know what I’m going to start off with and I want to try and prevent awkwardness in the conversation. Please can someone help out here?

It's not like I'll hurt a lot of people. My parents will be sad, my brother will. Obviously, I'm a part of their family so whatever. But who else? None of my fake-ass friends give a fuck about me. None of my teachers. I've got no one besides a therapist at my school who I'm seeing who I only kind of trust. No one fucking gets it and ever will.

I'm so fucking sick of pretending like I stopped cutting and that I'm OK now to my parents.

I deal/dealt with the most basic problems in life money &amp; drugs  which lead to relationship issues. I lost my mom/best friend almost 3yrs ago, who was my everything I'm a self proclaimed momma's boy. From there things got worst by the second. My family fell apart, my dad, brother, sister, some aunts and uncles stop seeing eye to eye and cause me to resent a few ppl. The only reason I haven't gone through with it is because of my kids. I know at the end of the day it's the wrong thing to do, it's just a phase, there will be better days ahead, my situation is mold in comparison to others. I get all that but when you constantly go backwards in life no matter how hard you try, and try and stay positive. It comes to a point when you feel like there is no other alternatives.

"I got into a fender bender today For those that dont know, a fender bender is a car crash which results in damage greater than a nick or scratch, and always has damaged body panels (pretty self explanatory)

 I got hit from behind while I was at a yeild trying to merge into the flow of traffic. Somehow the old lady who ran into me didn't know I was there and tried to force herself into the flow of traffic, but I was in the way. Fortunately, I was working at the time and was driving around a company van, so I don't have to worry about repairing my personal car. The impact was at pretty low speed, I was stopped and she was doing probably under 20km/h (~13mph?) so no one was seriously hurt. The intersection that I got hit is a really badly designed intercession with big blindspots and lots of fast moving traffic, so it wouldn't be uncommon for me to see an accident there once every couple weeks

I drive around my home city delivering auto parts for a living, so it was more a matter of when rather than if. Still, this was my first car accident (either driver or passenger). Scared the living shit out of me. The van I was driving is fine, it just needs a new bumper and a couple of new back doors. The check engine light didn't even come on. If I could properly latch the back doors I couldve kept driving it around and couldn't care less. Her SUV was a little more beat up though, as it looks like itll need a new bumper, rad, oil cooler, a/c condensor, etc. She actually took the plastic facia of my back bumper off and it was stuck in her grill when I got out to look. 

I'm glad that she didn't get hurt, she was probably 70ish years old. She was the first thing I checked on after I made sure that we were both parked off to the side of the road. A young man like me can heal, but someone her age would take a bit of effort to recover. 

No witnesses decided to stop and help. I guess they couldn't be bothered. It's a shame but unfortunately not uncommon in my city. 

For the first couple of hours after the accident my adrenaline was running really high (I could barely write down the other drivers info my hands were shaking so bad) so I didn't really feel anything but it's been about 9 hours since the accident and now my lower to mid back has really stiffened up and is giving me some grief. Don't worry though, I've already booked an appointment with my family doctor for tomorrow to see if any real damage has decided to show up.

"Drastic Times Call For Drastic Measures. Okay so I guess this post is kind of an improvisation of my real suicide note. I didn't know what I wanted to write so I want to type it instead and reevaluate some ideas for what I should actually write. Well, I'm currently 16 years old and a male, and I despise life and what it has offered me in these past 16 years. I was never diagnosed to see if I have this mental disability but I believe I have clinical depression. I've been heavily depressed for years and it has broken me down severely. I don't have a bright future ahead of me and I don't have any loved ones or friends. For these past years I have just sat in my room all day and just play video games and surf the net. I wasn't always like this, but even when I tried to be outgoing it didn't work out at all. I'm not intelligent, funny, attractive, and so forth. I understand that I may only be 16, but trust me, it wouldn't workout in the near future or present at all. I have suicidal ideations and tendencies everyday, however, I don't self harm or anything similar to that as I would just like to commit suicide rather than delay it with harming. The only problem is that I don't have any necessary materials or methods that would quicken my death. I want to do it by firearm but I have no access to one. Also, I can't ask for one since that would put that certain individual in deep trouble with the authorities for assisted suicide. I've never been in an intimate relationship as well, and nor have I ever had any intimate contact with the other sex. Also, I'm an immigrant that came to the states so sometimes I get racially profiled. Additionally, there are other certain circumstances that have put me in the position I am in today but those are a bit personal. And, it's quite a lot as well. I do not fear the thought of dying or knowing where I'll end up as soon as I become deceased. I just believe that I'll be in a pit of nothingness, with nothing around me and where I won't be able to feel anything. I understand that others will object to my decision and tell me that there is more out there for me, but there really isn't. I've tried to instill a new better perspective within myself but it's just not worth it anymore. I wouldn't wish this feeling or this life for that matter on anyone. I apologize if you find this post rather heartbreaking and harsh but it is what's best for me. If life had actually gotten better, then I wouldn't even consider this ""solution."" There are people who get a good life no matter what, and then there are the unfortunate ones who suffer.

"The Blaring Exit Sign - A Memoir to Departure.When I was a boy... The first thing I learned about anything was that my dad was not around. It was my grandmother that told me this. 
It's the very first memory I have of anyone telling me anything about who my parents were.
At the time, I never understood why. I was told he was on drugs, and that he couldn't help it.
I didn't understand what any of that meant until much later in my life.
When I was a boy... the first memory I have of my mother is her swearing at her alarm and telling me to go downstairs to my grandmother because she had to go.
I didn't even know who she was, but I remember feeling like she didn't like me very much.
I remember my grandmother and grandfather raising me. They gave me so much love and care, but I always felt cautious around them, like they would not entirely understand me. My grandmother tried her very best to understand, and what she was unable to understand, she was willing still to accept. I know this now, but I didn't know it back then. 
When I was a teenager, I had already had several experiences with other boys. I was hiding this fact at home, but expressing it at school, where I thought I was safe. I met a my first boyfriend in highschool and I was just happy to get some love from someone. It felt nice to be held and kissed by someone else. I would message this boy every day on myspace messenger, and we'd chat and talk about this and about that. Whatever 13 year olds chat about.
One day, my mother managed to break into my laptop and read those messages. She brough them to me like they were drugs. She printed them out and layed them infront of me and confronted me about them. I was being interrogated by her. I felt afraid. I was scared. I did not want to be rejected for this. I wanted to be accepted and understood. 
She played it cool, wanted me to admit it. I felt mortified to admit it. Absolutely terrified to say it outloud - but I risked it and told her the truth. That I thought I was bisexual, that I liked boys. 
For a few weeks everything was fine, she seemed to try to accept it and be okay with it. At some point though, I don't recall where we were... I remember she told me that I needed to listen to her when she told me to do something, or follow her orders when she directed me, or else she would tell Rita and Chris, my aunt and uncle whom I loved so much. She told me she would tell them, and that they would never let me near their children again. My little cousins, who I adored and loved spending time with. I learned to hide and bottle myself up so deep that I couldn't find it anymore. 
Over time spent like this, I learned that I didn't go after boys or gay men because I really enjoyed boys or gay men. I went after them because they were a source of affection I felt like I needed and I was never going to get anywhere else. When I found that girls could show that affection too, I was overwhelmed with joy at that fact because I realized I could actually get what I wanted.
I always looked for love with everyone I could. I wanted so badly to connect to anyone and everyone on that level. I didn't want to be rejected. I don't know if it's because I felt rejected by my mother, or because I never had a father -- but even my therapist concluded something I already knew; In his words: ""You need a lot of love, James... So much love.""
I was taken by those words, I never forgot them. I just nodded my head when he told me them and I felt like I had a way forward now, armed with this fact front and center in my mind.
So began my search for someone to love me and someone to love. I looked high and low. Near and far until I found it. I went through many heart-breaks to obtain it. I weathered many storms, and endured many nights. When I found her, I thought it was over. The hard part was over, and now all I had to do was build a life with her. I just needed to get to her first. I was so close. I had to keep going. 
When I met her, I remember feeling a sense of joy and overwhelming sadness because I had endured so much for that moment. I never wanted to let her go. After our first meeting, when I had to let her know, I cried my eyes out in the back seat of my best friend's car because I was just completely taken over by joy and sorrow. Pain and pleasure. I just could not bear it in that moment and I broke down in front of these people. 
By this point in the story, I had already moved several times in my life. I had lost friends over and over again from distance and separation. I hated the fact that I kept losing friends. I hated the fact that I never had a stable home. We moved again. From Kentucky, back to Virginia. I went from being 3 hours away to being 12 hours away from my love. We spent many nights on skype together. We'd video call and chat. It helped in its own way, but it also made it hurt so much worse at the same time. 
One day, for about a month, she came to visit me and stay with me at my mother's house. We spent so much time together. Every day was a new adventure. We'd stay up all night talking and laughing, kissing, holding each other. Making love, day dreaming. Taking pictures. She had to leave eventually, and when she did I took to the bottle to curb it. It was bitter-sweet. 
Maybe just a few weeks after this, I found something out... She had been talking with, meeting with. Kissing another person. Someone I hated. She did this behind my back, under my nose. She lied to my face about it when I asked her before finding out for sure. I wasn't just hurt. I was breaking apart as a person. Inside, I was shaking. I was falling into pieces of myself, those pieces were disintegrating in my hands. I was dying inside. I was furious. I was enraged. I could smell smoke. All I wanted was to burn this whole fucking world down. I had my heart broken so many times by this point, I was so plagued with self-doubt, self-hate. Feelings of not being good enough. I wasn't good enough for my Mother, I'm not good enough for my Dad. Im not good enough for this girl either. 
Thing's got complicated here... I was on so many drugs, I was snorting Klodopin and Xanax, smoking weed, cigarettes, drinking to excess. I was trying to not feel things. I was trying not to think. I was trying to forget every memory I made of this girl. I was trying to destroy myself as a person. I wanted to die, I wanted to die, I wanted to die. I wanted to die. I wanted to die so fucking bad but I was too much of a coward to just do it. To go play in traffic. To jump off the bridge. To drown myself. To overdose. To steal a gun and shoot myself. I never had the balls. I still had one tiny sliver of hope that kept me going. Because she would still talk to me. She would still call me. She still answered when I texted her. I wasn't thinking clearly here.
I hurt her so bad, over and over again. I don't remember by the time of me writing this, I dont remember ever doing it. But she has recordings, video, audio, and chatlogs, of me saying it. The things I did, the things I said. The things I threatened. I became the same kind of abusor to her that my mother was to me. Reel her in, throw her out. Reel her in, throw her out. Gain her trust; Destroy it. Rebuild it, break it. Break her down, build her up. 
This lasted longer than it should have, and one day she left. She got smart and she left me behind and I never could find her again.
...
Somehow, then, we got back together. The story is less than romantic this time around. I'm still increadibly bitter about everything that happened. I feel distant and detached from my own feelings. I dont even experience them as my own feelings anymore. My mind is so fractured by everything I had put up with that I Just couldn't feel the same way about her -- Or about anything.
I fell into this depression that I had a lot of trouble dealing with, and understanding, or even accepting was present. I had gotten so used to dealing with this every day that I just could not cope with having regular emotions anymore. When I was annoyed, I was enraged by it. When I was happy, I was overjoyed. When I was sad, I was breaking as a person. Serious mental dysfunction and mood swings. 
I remember driving home from work one day and thinking about gaining 120mph and slamming into a building to kill myself. I remember when I bought a shotgun to protect our house, I used to think about putting the barrel in my mouth and pulling the trigger, anytime something got me upset, or I felt like I coulnd't deal with it. There it was again.
The blaring exit sign. 
The bright red text spelling out ""ABORT"" in a bold font.
The guard rail down a flight of stairs out the side of a building.
Some years go by, and the man that my girl cheated on me with has died. He passed away from a drug over-dose. I felt sad, not for him dying, not for me losing him as a person I once knew, but because I knew my girl cared about this person. I knew It was hurting her. I hated him for dying just for this reason alone. I spoke at his funeral, I met his parents for the first time. I felt so broken by it, but so relieved... I'm still happy to this day that he's gone. I never tell anyone this, not even myself, not my spouse. No one. But I'm glad he's dead. The world is and always will be better off without him. 
She hears his voice now, talking to him. Manifest in a coping mechanism -- Hallucenations. She's fragmented as a person. She's not the same girl I fell in love with, or the one that broke my heart. I'm not the same man either. I'm weaker than I was at the start. Im broken too...
By this point, we've opened our relationship up sexually to other people; This after long discussions and talks about fetishes and weird interests. But, to be honest its all a coping strategy for me. I felt so insecure with her. I never felt like I'd be enough for her or anyone else. So I opened our relationship up just to never have to worry about it again. If there are no rules, you can't break them. I figure I'd spare myself the heartache. I didn't figure I would wander far, maybe I'd have a bit of fun with the odd one off partner now and again. It's been good so far I mean. We had some laughs with it. We've had fun. She never found a main-stay partner, or someone she really had the hots for, but there were a few people she's had sex with besides me while we've been together. I love seeing her happy and I know it makes her feel good, so I'm okay with it. I never told her this but It always made me feel empty as a person, but throwing those vows of intimacy away gave me a kind of catharsis. Reducing them to mean nothing made me feel less scared. Like a controlled demolition, sort of thing. 
I'm still with her but I don't really know why. Familiarity? Fear of being alone? No one has stuck by me for this long. I feel like I owe it to her. 
Fast foward to present day. We've moved again, from the last city to the new one here on the East Coast. I feel hopeful but still depressive most of the time. I'm learning to be a better me most days, and I'm finding Im able to make people laugh, and smile. I can bring joy to people's lives. It's all I really enjoy about work is making people smile. I rarely get to do it due to the nature of the work. There's a girl there I particularly like. She's so kind, and sweet, and funny, and she thinks I'm just hilarious. She thinks I'm amazing. She tells me about how I'm amazing and perfect, and that I make her laugh and feel things she's never felt before. She tells me how much I mean to her and that she doesn't want to lose me. We've hit it off real well. She kisses me in a way I haven't been kissed since I was 16. I feel like a kid again around her. She just makes my heart sing. I just want to show her the world - Take her places. Have her take me places.
But you know, my life so far, has been one great tragedy to the next. She's married. I know. I'm pathetic, and I have weak morals for participating in this. It's sad that I'm willing to accept scraps from this person. She's going to leave soon, with her husband, to the west coast. She'll probably never think about me again once she does go. 
My relationship with my girl is falling out from underneath me. I feel like its a hollow shell of what it could have been and never really was in the first place. I'm honestly okay with it at this point. She deserves a lot better than I could have ever provided; Weak as I am. She deserves to be happy. 
Between that, the fact that I think its beyond repair. That it'll never get better. This girl I like leaving. I feel like shes the one for me. The one I want. I can't have her. I'll never see her again.
There's that exit sign again.
I think I might see myself out this time. 

Thanks for 26 years of joy and pain. Thanks for everything everyone ever did for me to try to help. I'm sorry I'm throwing it all away. I'm sorry if this hurts you. I hope you forget me. I hope you don't think about me for very long. I hope some of you feel relieved at my absence. I hope you breathe a sigh of joy when you hear I'm gone.
I hope those that love me don't linger on my memory. I hope those that will miss me won't miss me long.
I love you all so much, but this world has been too much for me. It's been too much from start to finish. I just can't take much more of this.

"I can't even kill myselfI came to the realization that I can't even kill myself. It was the last choice that I thought I had left, but I can't even choose that. I have all these people that depend on me. It wasn't my choice to be in this position. I didn't create this family that all need me. I love my nephews, mother, and sister. But I am starting to hate them. They need me for their home and food and transportation. Every facet of all these lives on my shoulders. I tried to be the father they needed after theirs abandoned them. I'm realizing that I will NEVER live my own life. And now ai cant even end my life, because no one would care for them. My Father told me recently that the best thing I could ever do for the world would be to kill myself. I wish I could make him eat those words.
I have been sexually, physically, and emotionally abused my whole life. The only woman I ever loved cheated on me with my best friend. Everyone who didn't need me has left.

"fellow teen who needs to vent. I don’t know where else to add this but I’m really having a hard time right now so I need to get it off my chest.

In 2008 ( I was 8) my grandmother had a massive stroke that left her right side of her brain and body paralyzed and it changed her life forever. She was never the same. It was like I lost my grandmother when I was eight but she was still there but her mind and soul were gone. It was truly traumatizing and still makes me sick everyday. 

My family has had problems in the past with her spending her money (a lot of money) on things she shouldn’t and has been scammed across the board but she doesn’t know any better. 

Today I was on google and just happened to search her name up and came across the FEC (federal election commission) and her name popped up as of contributitors and I found over 700 donations in her name to “winred” and “trump MAGA” and several others  I haven’t been able to total it all so far but we are up to over $12,000 in donations to donald trump and a little over $11,000 to Mitch mconnell. My grandmother doesn’t have much money as it is. I am truly sick to my stomach. There’s nothing that can be done now but she’s spent thousands and thousand of dollars and she just doesn’t know any better and it sucks. At this point it’s beside the fact it’s to Donald trump (which is bad enough in itself) but it’s the fact that a woman who doesn’t know any better has now spent all of her money on political candidates that she gets no gain out of. This story is more in depth but this is the basis of it and I can’t write anymore because I’m truly sick to my stomach. Thanks for listening.

"A battle on the physics front. It had been a chaotic few weeks on the Physics front. The  generals back home were preparing a major offensive to break through the enemy lines and drive them back to the river of moments. r-139 Artillery Cannons had been shelling those bastards for 4 days non stop.Ladders were lined up against the trench walls , and the barbed wire had been taken down.Brain cells grasped their bolt action rifles anxiously, soon, the last shells fell, and an eerie silence fell over the battlefield, the brain cells all went over what to do in their heads, shaking. The silence was soon broken by a shrill whistle, signalling for the men to go over the top.

The brain cells climbed up the ladder into no student's land as fast as they could, some were shot down by fna machine guns before they could even make it.

Those who made it out of the trenches made a mad dash to the enemy trenches,but they were falling by the thousands each second , however, there were alot of bc's, hundreds upon thousands of them had come to the trenches to fulfill their duty, hopefully there would be enough, enough power to pass this living hell onto the peace that lay afterwards.


The fna machine guns tore through their lines but still, the bc's managed to get past no student's land and entered the enemy trenches, and entered into close combat with the enemy.Even after the losses at no student's land, they still heavily outnumbered the opponent's, victory was close at hand, but the bc's didn't have much time left, the gods above would be very unhappy if they continued this disturbance for any longer , they would null all their gains if they didn't end the battle soon and the enemy knew this, thus they hid in corners and kept on resisting knowing that they only needed to keep their defences up for a little bit longer for the battle to end in their victory.


In the end however, the enemy was too devastated by the shelling , they couldn't have a proper rest for days on end and too many of them had died . This caused a mass route sending the forces of physics running away for their lives , the battle had been won and a temporary peace established.",,Anxious

So I have kids, some from a previous marriage.  They are my twins.  I am the father and have full custody of all of my kids.  Coming from the state I did, that's a miracle.  Through my job we had to move some, which took us away from the twins birth mom, who at the time had a pretty bad drug problem.  I have stories for days about what this chick would do.  Needless to say, when the split happened, she told the twins that they would end up living with her, and then basically abandoned them, while blaming me for her doing so.    


All this time I have had to be the one that pays all the bills.  The wife has had a job or two here or there, but it never lasts for long and there is always some reason why.  I don't mind too much cause she is there to watch the kids.  Well during one of the periods she was working, we found out that our twins were doing some raw shit.  Smoking weed, and drinking among other things.  Shit blew up, the cops got involved, CPS was involved, everyone was involved.  None of the kids were taken because  it wasn't an abuse case or anything.  They offered us services, which the kids refused to be a part of, and it was difficult for me to be a part of (because of my having to work so much).    


Twins go on their trip to see their birth mom for a few weeks for the summer, during which one of my twins writes this letter that she hates me, and hates living with me and would rather be with her mom.  That she has a plan to make it so that I ship her back to her mom, so that she can then get a job, and pay her mom back for all the trouble she has caused her.  I can't even make this shit up.  I don't know how her sister feels, but I am deeply hurt.  On top of that, we have reason to believe that she is the one that has recently called CPS on us, claiming that we are junkies (needle junkies at that) that are beating and starving our kids.  Wife is absolutely convinced of this and has demanded that they don't come back to our house.    


So here I am stuck in the middle, once again, between a wife that is telling me that I have to get rid of my kids, and my kids basically acting, and stating, that they hate me.  I have done a lot for all of them, and now I have basically throw it all away.  I feel so terrible right now that I would rather die than deal with this.   


On top of everything else, this does not help my PTSD/Depression/Anxiety whatsoever. I can't eat. Have been up all night crying and it's randomly happening as well. I am so angry and hurt that it's hard to even do my job (Customer Service). I feel sick and I don't want to even bother going home.  Why can't a fucking meteor or something just crash through and kill me? Why can't I catch one of these fucking stray gang bullets or something?  I fucking hate my life. It's been nothing but a struggle and a terrible shit show for as long as I can fucking remember.  It hurts, and I am too tired to fight it any more. I really wish I just had the strength to end it all..............",,Depressed

"I want to kill myself for no good reason.Every morning I wake up with the same feeling ""I hate myself, I hate my life, I want to die, I'm going to kill myself."" I'm 36 and it's  been like this for as long as I can remember. I constantly wonder if today is going to be the day I finally do it. 

And I know I have a million reasons to keep on going. I have a decent job, support myself and have  many friends, family, coworkers and other loved ones that would be devastated if I killed myself. I have creative hobbies like filmmaking and podcasting and a lot of people enjoy what I produce.

And yet the feeling persists. I feel like I'm a terrible person and don't deserve to live. I feel like I'm wasting my life, that nothing I do has any meaning. I have constant feelings of shame and guilt about things I've done in the past. And even though those things were a long time ago, I can't seem to put them behind me even though I've become a better person since then.

I've been seriously depressed for most of the winter. I always get down on life during the cold months but this year was just brutal, when I wasn't at work, all I did was lay in bed watching YouTube videos and wishing that I would just die in my sleep. Sometimes I would lay in bed all day. Thus enhancing the feeling that I'm wasting my life, but I just couldn't seem to get out of bed and be productive. And although the warmer weather has helped out a bit, I'll still sleep away much of the time I'm not at work.

I have so many things that haunt me. I did some terrible things in my early 20s that I could have done serious prison time for. I also impregnated my girlfriend when she was 20 and left her when I was 5 months pregnant. Long story short, I have no contact with my daughter and haven't since she was 3 years old - she's now 12.

I coped with all this in my mid 20s by doing a lot of drugs. Ecstasy was my main drug, I would spend all my free time and money downing as many pills as I could with my raving buddies. Spent 4 years in a constant haze. I eventually overcame it, but I still live with the shame of being a deadbeat drug addict when I should have been going to college and being a father.

I know that even though a lot of these things are really bad, none of them justify taking my own life. But the voices inside my head won't stop telling me that I'm worthless and don't deserve to live. I fantasize about ending my life all the time. It's a constant theme in my head. 

I'm convinced that one day I will die by suicide. It's just a matter of when. And everyday that goes by is a constant battle with these feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, shame and guilt.

I've been through therapy, and have a psychiatrist that has diagnosed me with Bi-polar II and anxiety. I take my pills everyday. And they help somewhat but the constant critical voices in my head tell me to end it now rather than go through the next 40 years like this.",,Depressed

"I think I might do it soon?I thought I'd learned not to, but I'm really seriously considering it again. I've tried about four times in the past year and I've never had that ""I'm so glad I didn't succeed!"" moment that I've seen a lot of others have. The last time I tried was Jan. 26, and since then I've tried to be all positive and recovery-oriented and shit, but I never really felt it all that much and I'm feeling it less and less now. I've come really close a few times since then, including once when I was actually sitting on the edge of an eight-story parking garage, but I haven't followed through.

It just feels so pointless. I've been hospitalized six times since last October--six! They always keep me a long time, too, since they say I'm a really severe case, and all together I've spent about two months in the hospital. Two months sitting and coloring and shuffling around from therapy group to therapy group, and I'm still not better. It helps, but I always lose that recovery momentum once I'm out.

I feel like a huge failure. Everyone thought I was going to do something great. I was 1st in my high school class of 600 and I got a really competitive scholarship that covered everything for college. They only give a few per year and you're expected to really do something with it. They were happy with me at first--I studied hard and took summer classes in foreign countries and everything they expect, but I always felt like a huge fraud and now it's obvious. While the other fellows in my year spent this past year, our senior year, doing important projects and getting accepted to impressive grad programs, I spent mine in the psych ward. I didn't even graduate in the end. I still plan on finishing--it would only be a few more classes--but lately I don't see the point. I just don't like life and I'm not any good at it either.

I don't think the people who know me best would be too surprised if I died. The doctor at the hospital even told my parents he doesn't expect me to live through 2013.

I want to find a reason to keep living, because that's what people are supposed to do, right? I don't even really want to kill myself--what I'd really like is some kind of fatal accident so I don't have to do it myself. Or a stroke or heart attack--supposedly I have an eating disorder and they tell me my heart is in a lot of danger, trying to scare me into eating normally again, but I really don't care. I can feel my heart going wonky every so often, and I hope that it's finally going to kill me.

I'm not doing it tonight or anything (hey, I'm looking forward to Arrested Development in a few days), but I think it might be soon. I've got a plan, but then since I was about 16 I've always had a plan. Maybe I'll find a reason to keep going in the next few days, though. I hope so.",,Depressed

While time is going slow and you are in school please take a look around and reflect upon what you are struggling with right now. Take small steps to get past whatever hardships you are going through.  It will be scary, but the future you will thank you! I can't understate this enough.

My personal hardships in high school which I still haven't moved past have been:
Major social anxiety especially with women
Major confidence issues
Having very minor amounts of friends.
Having a porn addiction since the age of 11 give or take.
Never valuing myself

If you relate to or have your own struggles please work to resolve them now. We only have one life and one time on this earth.  Also trust me these problems never get any easier. Tomorrow never comes. Saying I'll do this tomorrow and then the next DAT saying the same. Soon it you will be my age and realize you still haven't gotten past your fears.

Please please take the steps now to better your life.

I have been bullied for 8 years now, never been in a relationship, never kissed, last hug was a year ago and it's summer break so I don't socialize at all.


I hate socializing because of my anxiety and fear of strangers. I usually just keep a low profile and deal with it.


I haven't been happy for a while now and also I have been thinking about ending it all. I have been going to my school therapist for a while but it just makes matters worse because it puts me thinking about my lifes details even more and makes me even sadder.


I am the middle child from a 5 person family. Our family is in a good financial and social place. I am not really poor nor rich, my parents aren't alcoholics or anything like that. My parents spoil my younger sister and allways yell at my older sister. I'm just there and no one really notices me that much unless they need something.

"Welp.Ahhh....what a miserable life. Having been depressed since highschool (or possibly earlier, but there's no way to tell other than remembering how hard I took things happening) with me being traumatized by dumb crap (the first girl I ever asked out saying yes, then 2 weeks later after coming back from camp, telling me she had a boyfriend, then proceeding to tell everyone that I was stalking her) and simply being too big of a loser to make anything of myself (still have done nothing more intimate besides give someone a hug or get a girlfriend, also just wasting my life away playing videogames and nothing else constructive).

I'm 25 and feel a strong dislike (or quite possibly hatred) towards most other people (mostly caused from working a retail job and seeing how people truly are), overweight and just in general have very low self-esteem.

I can't stand the fact that I'm depressed over random stupid crap either, with how weak I really am that I can't surmount this. Until tonight I couldn't bring myself to slash my wrists and even then, the razor I was using was too dull or I just couldn't apply enough force despite wanting to die so badly.

"I don’t want to die, I just no longer want to existI don’t have anyone anymore. Estranged and complicated relationship with my parents. In college doing classes I’m not passionate about. Have a job making decent money and it’s good for my resume but it’s so mentally draining. My partner left me to find herself and has fallen into a large friend group that is always there for her. I have not had that same luck. The other night I was in a really bad spot and hit up all the few friends I have anymore. No response or they were busy. I live in Buffalo, NY and took the quick drive up to Niagara Falls in a bad snowstorm. I parked my car but left it unlocked so someone could move it easily if I went over the edge. It was late at night and no one was around. I just watched the rapids leading to the edge of the earth. All I had to do was hop that railing and it’s not my problem anymore. One swift decision and it’s over. I screamed and I cried and hit myself in the head because my piece shit brain doesn’t even know what to do. I couldn’t physically do it. I couldn’t do that to my mother. I couldn’t do that to my ex who would blame herself for life. I have no one to understand me but 50 people that would show up for my funeral. That’s why I can’t die.

So yesterday, I was texting my friend and we were talking about girls. I guess I'm more attractive than I've ever been because recently I've been getting a lot of of female attention. So I was telling my friend all the girls I've been ""talking"" to. I wasn't really talking to them it was just people I was interested in and had been texting me. 

Then, about 10 minutes later I go on twitter. I see something that makes my heart drop. My friend who I was texting had screenshotted the text with me listing all the girls I was ""talking to"" and must have sent it to his friend because he ""thought it was funny"". That guy proceeded to put it on twitter. It didn't include my name but I know that everyone knows it was from me. 

A few minutes later, I get calls and texts from all the girls I mentioned asking what the fuck was going on and how we aren't talking. The story I've been telling them all is that it was a joke and that the screen shot was taken out of context. But I don't think anybody believes me and I probably wouldn't believe me if were them either. 

So anyway I got the guy who put the picture up to delete the tweet but the damage was already done. Every girl in the school hates me now, especially the ones in the screenshot. One of them I was really attached to. 
So now I've CONSTANTLY got this absolutely horrible feeling in my gut and it hasn't gone away since all of this happened. That, coupled with huge stress for school, debt from a car accident I was in, I just want it all to end.

"in case no one told you today, someone cares about you [long post]When I was in 7th grade, I was going through a really hard time. I drifted from all of my friends, developed depression and social anxiety, and most importantly, I began to lose myself. I would go to school and feel so self conscious that I wished I would just melt into the floors or hide in the bathrooms so nobody could see me. This was also the year that I dipped into self harming — everyday after school, I would go to the upstairs bathroom and cut my legs on the bathroom tile. Suicidal ideation didn’t just pop up in my head occasionally, it festered inside my brain and wrapped around every one of my fingers and strapped my wrists so I couldn’t escape the horrible pain I was enduring. I had no one to talk to. I pushed my family away and hid inside my room 24/7. 

But I made it through it at the time. 

Entering into 8th grade, I wasn’t cutting so much. Actually, I distinctly remember feeling bitterly numb. Unlike in 7th grade where my suffering may have been more apparent, this time I learned how to ease on a fake smile and pretend to be the bubbly, yet quiet girl I was. I also dipped into makeup to hide all the insecurity I was filled with. Perfectionism was my worst enemy at the time. My emotions were still there, somewhere, but my depression drowned them so they muffled underneath the dark waters. It was strange how someone could feel absolutely nothing to the point where they weren’t sure if they were happy or not, or really, even existed. It was like no one could see me, hear me, pay any mind to me at all. I had my friends back again, finally. But despite getting what I wanted for so long, something wasn’t right. 


I was empty. 


October 23rd, 2018
I never really cared for dates, and this was no exception — yet somehow, I remember this one. I don’t know how. I guess I must’ve caught a glimpse of it a few times and awhile later, it still sticks with me. This day was distinctive in the way that after grueling, long mundane days, I felt again. I felt anxiety, I felt sadness, I felt angry, I felt everything that I should’ve been feeling the past few months. It all caught back up to me and pulled me down to the ground, where I could be eaten alive by all of them. I was helpless and had no way of protecting myself. It felt like the world was ending — but it wasn’t — maybe it was for me. 

I cried on the edge of my bed, shaking uncontrollably. An empty bottle of pills were thrown somewhere in the covers, presumably to be hidden from whoever was to found them. I swallowed them all, but I could’ve swore I could still smell the fein odor of medicine in the back of my nose and throat. It was horrible. That smell and taste still haunts me to this day. Eventually my sister came to take me to her house, and as we got into an argument, she wasn’t too nice with me. Having no idea what I just did, she forced me into her car and blasted the radio and sang songs with my brother who was in the backseat while I lay in the passenger seat, crying and trying my best not to puke. We made it to her house, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I tried to open the door enough so I didn’t vomit inside, but unfortunately it got on the inside and outside of the car. My sister was pissed. She told me I forced myself to throw up and screamed at me that I would clean it up. I cried. 

I went in the shower to wash up and texted my friend that I had just done something, crying uncontrollably and trembling all over. She was the only one that knew. That evening, I was time skipping. I remember there being moments where my sister was on one side of the room and suddenly appeared on the other. I was so dizzy and a little nauseous. She thought I was having a panic attack and called my aunt to help me. My aunt tried to calm me down, and it didn’t really work, but I promised her I would at least try. She left. I went back to bed and sat staring at the walls and my phone, and once again, I could’ve sworn I was only sitting there for 10 minutes but suddenly 2 hours passed by. I don’t know why, but I dragged myself out of the covers and went downstairs.

I looked at my sister in the eyes, and I felt this sizzling panic erupt between us before I even told her anything. Finally, I told her, “I need to tell you something”. She began to vigorously demand what it was, and I was sobbing, and she started to cry too. It may have been sisterly intuition, but she asked me if I took pills and I nodded. It took literally hours of convincing that I actually took these pills for my sister and aunt to take me to the ER, and the dread in the room when the doctor came to tell us that my liver enzymes were way, way too high and that I would have to be rushed to a bigger hospital in an ambulance was one I would never forget. 

I was fourteen years old, and that was my first attempted suicide. 


At the time, I learned a lot of things. I learned that if you don’t get the proper help you need, you will turn to other things to make you feel better, good or bad. I put on that fake smile again when I came back home from the hospital and no one stopped me. No one liked to talk about what I did, so I had to find different ways of coping. I developed an eating disorder to distract myself, especially since I was homeschooled now and had a lot more time to myself. I hid inside my own comfortable room so no one could see me. I took writing more seriously, but the things I’d write were sad. I went to a therapist, but I could only see her once a month... after a suicide attempt. I definitely needed more counseling than that, but it’s as if everyone believes you’re cured from ideation once you acted on it. That’s surely not the case.

The thing that really opened my eyes were the people around me. I will never forget how my sister never left my bedside at the hospital, and how she never judged me about what happened despite it hurting her. She blamed herself. She looked so heartbroken, but tried to hide it, just like I did. This was the same girl that I would get in fights with constantly and used to throw me around the living room by my pigtails when we were younger. Who would’ve thought she cared for me this much. 

I never seen my dad cry. But after a long flight from Florida to Dayton Hospital, he was sobbing so badly that it was sorta embarrassing, but sweet nonetheless. Both of my parents ran towards me and wrapped me up and kept saying incomprehensible stuff like, “my baby girl” and “you scared me so much” “I thought I would lose you”. 

I had a childhood friend named Heath that my mom used to babysit. He was one of the popular kids at school at the time, so he and I didn’t talk much. Maybe on occasion, but that was it. There was still familiarity between us though, and we both felt it. He used to take a photo of us as babies into class and show it to the whole classroom to tease me. In my opinion, he looked more like a dork in those photos than I did, but whatever. We drifted apart, and it began to feel like he didn’t care for me at all anymore: he was a popular kid and ignored me in school now. When I came home from the hospital, my mom needed moral support, so one day without my knowledge she went to their house. She came back, and I knew she was hiding something. Finally after so many efforts in trying to get her to say something, she finally admitted that she did tell them about my suicide attempt. She told me that Heath in particular was shooken up and cried when hearing it. I was shocked — I was so sure that this kid gave no mind to me ever, and I felt like he wouldn’t have noticed if I was gone. Now, I don’t want to know what his reaction would’ve been like if I succeeded. I really thought he didn’t care... at all.

My ex best friend must’ve been the worst. She was popular as well and a grade up. We were inseparable when we were younger — really, since we were babies. But we were split. Not by choice, necessarily, it just happened. It was like a breakup. I lost my one and only best friend and she felt like she was so far away: it turns out she was in closer reach than I initially thought. We hadn’t really talked in years, but since my mom was best friends with her step mom, occasionally she convinced me to get out of my house and hangout with her again. At first it was awkward, because to me she was a totally different person, but eventually we both eased up and it was like the old her was back again. My mom joked that she could only act herself around me now, because all her other friends were the stereotypical cheerleader popular girls. I noticed that too. She did act drastically different around them, and not like the girl I used to know. But with me, she could act any way she wanted to. This is the part I really regret. She always asked me to hangout, really, like begged me, but i would constantly turn her down. I was still accustomed to shutting everyone out of my world. I know she was hurt by this. Even when my mom would randomly show up on their doorstep she would ask if I came, and if I didn’t, why. It hurts my heart. I could’ve had my best, best friend back. But I isolated myself instead, and she eventually gave up. I would still like to hangout with her, because I genuinely admire her as a person and I love her.


My grandma that I wasn’t too close to started to text me everyday after what happened. She told me about her day and asked about mine. Like I said, I wasn’t close to her and didn’t visit her a lot, but she kept me in mind every single day, which is something I would’ve expected at all. She’d send me pictures of windmills she saw that day and told me that she was glad I loved her too. It warmed my heart but also made me feel bad for what I did. 

Lastly, in the hospital there was a moderator that I will never forget. They’re in charge of watching over people that are in hospital for hurting themselves, so he was in my room a lot. Thankfully he was a really great guy, just like most of the moderators were (thankfully) so it was nice to have that kind of person around after such a traumatic experience. I drew a picture for him because as I heard, he saves them and a lot of kids that are in for suicide attempts do that (we have nothing else to do waiting for our bodies to be healed from whatever horrible things we did to it). The picture was so bad because I had to use crayons. They didn’t let you have pencils or pens or any of the sort. They gave me a spoon for a salad, and he convinced the people to let me eat with a fork which was very nice of him. And when I didn’t want to eat, he would literally call up food for me anyway lol. Anyway, he appreciated the horrible drawing (pretty sure it was a pumpkin for Halloween :/) and I still wonder if he actually kept it. 

There was one thing that he told me before I was discharged, and it was so simple, but had a huge impact on me. He said before he left, “Take care of yourself, kiddo.” I don’t know what it was about those words but it ached my heart a lot. Maybe because I wasn’t exactly planning on taking care of myself, to be honest. But keeping his words in mind, it makes me feel like I would disappoint him if I didn’t at least try. 

There’s so many people surrounding you at all times and you don’t even know it. There’s thousands, everywhere, and trust me when I say at least one of them care about you. I had people that I thought forgot about me and wouldn’t notice if I wasn’t home, but it turns out those are the people that had the biggest impact on me, and I had the biggest impact on them as well. Stay home. Stay here. Stay safe. 

Take care of yourself, kiddo :)",,Depressed

"What's the psychology of suicide?I thought it was necessary asking here, since it may be useful understanding for those who are considering it.

As far on what I think it is, I believe it's where your brain cannot distinguish reality vs. fantasy. If we're talking from an evolutionary point, humans are the only species that commit suicide. The only reason we commit suicide is because we believe it's a solution on ending the pain. The brain thinks suicide is the solution to help you survive better, but in reality it's the opposite.


I don't think happiness is a choice, otherwise we would all be happy. I think people are depressed because we are genetically wired for our brains to be more stimulated, much like an ADHD person is. Perhaps this is an evolutionary trait. I think modern society has made this difficult for depressed people since most of society caters to your average person.

By the way, I do not have depression, but I'm trying to understand it better. I thought giving out my ideas of depression is a way to get a better understanding, which I think understanding is the most important trait in this world.",,Depressed

"All the horrible shit on my conscience right now, every day is a battle.  

Basically I'm a 15 year old male, and everyday is a struggle. I've got some horrible things on my conscience and I'm not deserving of any kind of sympathy I know, even if maybe I am looking for it. I don't know how long this post is going to be because I'm going to type what I have on my conscience right now.

I was messing around with my little 5 year old sister, we were just boxing and lightly punching each other and when I lightly jabbed her in the chest, I felt like a sex offender and feel like I did it because I wanted to touch her up or something. I'm honestly so scared and feel like a horrible person.

Whilst I was having sex with my girlfriend, I think I came inside her on purpose. When I say this, I mean as in getting to the point of the start of cumming (pushing it as far as possible) and then pulling out. Meaning that maybe the first bit of cum went inside her. I understand this was stupid and I don’t know why I did it and I’ve also spoken to her about it and she wasn’t mad, but I feel really guilty. Maybe I was just pushing my luck I don’t know, but I have bad anxiety and now I’m panicking that it’s sexual assault or something.

I was masturbating the other night, when I came across a friend’s snapchat story, with a picture of his dead sister(who is like 5) captioned “I miss you”. I’m pretty sure I felt guilty for even viewing this whilst I was doing what I was doing, and furthermore I think I had a sexual thought about it. My heart aches. I don’t even remember the facts anymore. I feel like I tried to push it out of my head. But maybe I didn’t. Maybe it got me off. I don’t know how I can ever live with myself after this. I’m disgusting. I'm not even attracted to kids or anything like that.

Something that happened with my girlfriend, we were in bed and I was rubbing her ass, and eventually I was rubbing her clit area, I don't think I actually fingered her but maybe I did I don't even know anymore. At this point she had fallen asleep. I don't think I was even aware that she had fallen asleep until she 'woke up', but again I don't know, I guess I never do. I felt so horrible and told her what happened. She told me it was okay and that I didn't violate any of her boundaries. We then established some boundaries, and this leads me onto my next misdeed.

Once again, I was in bed with my girlfriend, this time it was early in the morning and I'm pretty sure I was still half asleep. I had my eyes shut and then I felt her giving me head. I opened my eyes and she wasn't, she was turned around, facing the other way presumably asleep. Now I don't understand why I felt that, was it a dream? I really don't know, but then I had a thought that maybe I was fucking her whilst she was sleeping. This thought ripped me apart and I know that it seems unlikely but my brain really wants me to believe it. And I guess sometimes I do. I feel horrible. I told my girlfriend about this too, and she said that it didn't happen. She said that she would have woken up and it just all sounds like a complete long shot. She said that even if it did happen, she isn't hurt and she doesn't care whatsoever. My brain can't accept this. The fact that I don't know what truly happened is killing me, so I am just assuming the worst and my brain keeps adding more complexities to the situation that further criminalise me. Maybe I did put my dick inside her purposefully, I can't remember any of it and it's making me hate myself.

I also feel horrible for some thoughts that I have, unspeakable thoughts. Thoughts about incest, rape, and more fucked up shit. Nothing I'd ever do. And I know for sure I would never do these things with intent, but the thoughts make me feel so horrible. I truly believe I'm a disgusting person.

Another thing that happened, My sister, who is thirteen (nearly fourteen), was lying on her front in the middle of the floor. As I was going past, I stomped on her foot a few times (not hard, just messing around I guess) and her ass moved. I looked. I feel so disgusting. Why would I even look at my sister like that. It's fucking disgraceful. Maybe I did it knowing her ass would move. It doesn't matter. I'm a freak either way.

I also hit my girlfriend once. She was sat on top of me and as I sat up or moved or whatever, I hit her. Now I'm pretty sure it was an accident. But again my brain convinces me otherwise and maybe it wasn't. I cried pretty much straight away, It upset me because she's been through so much and I don't want to cause her pain. She's the most amazing girl and she's been here for me through absolutely everything, no matter what, she's never left my side. She's a blessing to this cruel world.

Yesterday, I was struggling so I decided to text a helpline. I texted to the woman for a bit and I was on my computer at the same time, I think at one point tho (whilst I was on my computer and waiting for responses), I got in one of those moods and I ended up having a wank. Now I feel so shitty because what if someone was going to commit suicide and really needed the help but I denied them that and they actually did. I feel so horrible and guilty.

The other day I had a thought and it makes me feel disgusting. The thought was of me fucking my sister and I don't even think it turned me on it was just lingering in my head. At the time I was also really horny and fancied a wank. I got scared because I didn't want to think this thought whilst I did that, I'd have felt really horrible and guilty. I was really horny and I stroked my dick a few times, not even masturbating I guess, but the thought was still in my head at the time. In the end I was too scared and didn't masturbate. Now I can't get over this, and I feel so guilty because I basically thinking about that thought, considering I kind of stroked my dick. It's so wrong and I feel so guilty.",,Anxious
"Is it weird for someone our age to like marbles and dominos? I've always been into marbles and dominos, but never had them as a kid. Now, I have the chance to get some but I feel sorta self-conscious about it all. I’m known for displaying a relatively sophisticated and mature sense of self. So, I’m just afraid that people might stop taking me seriously because I like things that are considered childish. What’s your take on the matter?

"does this essay sound to suspicious? for one of my assignments for school I had to write about how quarantine was in a pandemic.......I thought of a maybe brilliant or stupid idea for this essay. And I’m just wondering if it’s too suspicious? 💀

“I live in a suburban neighborhood. My name is anonymous user  . I’m 15 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a anonymous user. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.”

"I hate days like this.Waking up with ice cold limbs. Spending an hour trying to muster up the strength needed to push the damn blanket off of me even when I was already late for work upon opening my eyes.


I get these fits of rage, where I just want to scream and yell and punch everyone and everything that made me hurt so much until my knuckles bleed and my fingers can't move anymore.


I grind my teeth so much in repressed anger I'm kind of surprised they haven't cracked yet.


Of course, the anger leaves eventually. Used to swap places with that warmness an honest ""thank you"" or ""good to see you"" gives you.


Now there' s just nothing after the rage. Just me, screaming in my car until my tears choke me out.

At that point I usually pull into my driveway, roll a joint or 2 and give my tears the finger by slowing my brain down to a point where it doesn't even know how to properly be sad anymore. I want to tell you though: that state of mind doesn't come close to happy either.


I cut out almost all of my friends, feeling betrayed that they didn't realize me begging for help when I started spiraling downwards.


Not I'm sitting at my work desk supposed to fix problems i warned my boss ages ago, but he wouldn't listen.


I'm 23,this isn't how my life is supposed to look like. Everything is so exhausting, I feel like there is a constant ""battery about to die"" - message floating in my forehead.


I lost my charging cable. Maybe I never even knew how to use it in the first place, everything just keeps getting worse.



I can't talk to my parents about how I'm feeling. I have to be strong and smart and at least reasonibly successful, because all my 4 siblings have straight up completely failed to accomplish anything in life and it doesn't seem like any any of them are gonna straighten up soon. Lazy Bastards. Let ""almostnotinsecure""do it, he is mommas golden boy anyway. 


Fuck 'em, all of them. Fuck the rain too and the people still leaning on my help even though I stopped offering it ages ago.



I ain't that strong anymore, maybe I never really was.



I just want a hug and someone telling me that it's gonna be alright. I just feel so empty some days. And I hate these days.


I typed this message out like 12 times before, not having the nuts to even ask strangers on the internet for help, fearing to tear down this wall of fake stoicism and strength, which is robbing me of all sunlight and weighing heavy on my every being.



Sleeping has become my favorite thing to do. When I'm high enough i don't even get the nightmares, which haunt me since I was 5.

On days like this I don't want to wake up anymore. I just want to roll on my other side and close my eyes until everybody who still cares about me, or needs me has forgotten me and I will know what peacefulness feels like.



I have no idea why I'm writing this. I am sorry you had to read through me puking my thoughts out into the nothingness. I wanted to end this with something positive and hopeful, but I now that I started being honest I might as well stick to it. I have no idea what hope feels like anymore.



Thanks for sticking around with me, if even only for this little while. I wish I could've been the power plant other people would describe me as.

I’m tired of going on. For the 23 years I’ve been alive, I have never been truly happy. Since I was 4 years old I was just made to be sexually abused. At the hands of my biological father and so many others in my life. I never understood what was wrong with me. Why I was constantly targeted by men. Always sexually subjectified even as a young girl.. I became using serious drugs at only 12. Starting cutting myself even earlier.. I hate myself and who I’ve become. Someone who is weak. All I do is think negatively. It eats away at my soul and there is nothing positive left inside me. I feel so bad for everyone who has known me. I’m just a piece of shit and they all know it. The only thing that I have to offer anyone is my appearence.. that’s all anyone cares about. I can’t tell you how many stalkers I’ve had at every job I’ve worked. I’ve been taped by a bestfriend. Raped by my dad since a child and continually. Molested. Physically abused by ex boyfriends. I can’t take this pain anymore. I can’t talk to anyone about how angry I am and how much I truly hate myself because they don’t want to hear it. But I can’t keep it in anymore..... my baby’s dad hates me and thinks I’m a whore with nothing to offer anyone. And I believe that. I’ve given men what they want at the expense of my own emotions. I am physically numb in my body. I don’t enjoy anything in life. I never want to eat.. Each day I’m fading away. I have numerous health problems and none of the doctors can help me. Had an appointment for over 6 months at Stanford,the other day, showed up to find out I couldn’t be seen.. I have the worst luck guys. I no longer want to fight for my health. I give up. So this is my goodbye. I’m sorry and I wish I had the strength in me to not let go but I’ve been holding this rope for years. I’ve lost my grip now. This beautiful world will be missed.

I looked up a few methods and can either do it with a rope and doorframe, a gun, or some gas. Why am I still afraid? 

I'm feeling utterly consumed with hatred and anger and darkness lately. I feel so unlike myself. Saying and thinking and doing things that are so extremely dark and mean and angry. Yet I go to kill myself and suddenly I'm scared again. I want the pain and anger and sorrow to hype me up to get it over with but each time I get scared I'll go to hell. I wanted God to be real my whole life, but after all I have begged for and no help? How can believe. And if I don't believe why am I still scared of hell? If hell doesn't exist what happens if I die? If God and hell are real does it mean that even God has left me like everyone else?

"so sad i am so sad. my mom cheated on my dad. but before that, yesterday me and my mom had a fight. a yelling one. i am so sad. she just kept going. my nom is very toxic. but I love her. she’s my mom. after we were done (during this she was saying shit about how I am such a rude child a bad child a lazy child and then she was going to hit me) my dad stepped in Because she was going to hit me. he said he didn’t care if he was going to jail, that if she were to hit me he would stop it. and then she stopped looked at me and said “well fine. you can have him.” after that she left. she took her things and left. i am such a bad person. if I didn’t fight with her she wouldn’t have left, and my dad wouldn’t be sad. and we could of stayed the same. then my mom sent my dad her location for the first time. a couple days ago my dad sat on the floor and prayed for the third time in his life to give him a sign that my mom was cheating on him with someone else he told me. her sending him location was the sign I guess. my dad kinda assumed she was cheating, cause it’s 5:20 am and the fight happened at like 4 pm yesterday, and she still hasn’t come home. and the location was one where we didn’t know about. and she’s petty like that. idk. they’ve been married for 16 years, ever since i was born. they’ve had their ups and downs, my mom used to kick him out for being useless she said, when all he did was not listen to her and do what she said at that moment, but that was when I was very little. my mom wants everything done her way. everything has to be done the way she said it and right when she said it. she’s very controlling. one of my brothers left because of her years years ago. she was so controlling over his money. So he left. I haven’t spoken to him in years I miss him. but I haven’t spoke to him because of my mom. now one of my other brothers wants to move out because of her, because of how controlling she is. but if she leaves us then what are we gonna do,,,? my younger brothers freshly turned 14, my dad doesn’t have a job right now, my elder brothers work yes but I would like them to save money, and my sister lives on her own and I really don’t wanna hassle her. i am just so sad. i thought my parents were good. I thought they had a break!!! but then this happens. i didjt ask my dad to step in when she was going to hit me, I didjt ask for him to help me I didn’t ask for him to talk to her in my defense. but he did. because he said he love us. which broke my heart. this is all my fault. we fought over my school and my grades. and how I apparently sleep all day and barely leave my room. I dont sleep all day, I just have trouble falling asleep at night cause I have insomnia I don’t know what she thought. i barely leave my room because of her. because she would just harass me whenever I left my room. I was so sad to hear that my dad thinks my mom cheated on him after they’ve been together for like 20 years :( is it common for couples to go for this long?? and to not have any problems?? idk. if only we could of made my mom happy maybe she wouldn’t have left us. my dad is singing and it hurts. he’s so sad. he’s so sad she cheated on him. I am so sad to see that. and to hear that. I already saw him cry and I broke down. I hâte m’y mom. but I also don’t hate her. I hope she’s happy I guess, with that other dude she’s staying with. I wonder if he has kids cause of how old she is. I wonder if those kids like her and wonder if those kids will listen to her every day and follow her orders directly and let her control them.

I hate to say this, but I’ve been here before. I have actually helped others when I can. But this time I just can’t handle it anymore. After spending a year and a half trying to get back my first and only love. I have discovered that she is engaged after a year and a half of being broken up. We were together for three years and I even watched her dad die with her sister.

Her dad was one of my best friends. He told me a lot about things that I didn’t know. And Now or year and a half after we broke up All I want is to die. I lost my best friend, my soulmate and a great friend. For the past three months, I have been trying to figure out a way of getting back in touch with my ex, who I thought about every day and every second I can think of. 

The other day I texted her from a friends phone after she had contacted me to thank me for letting her know that a friend of hers had passed away. She called me twice and texted me three times, But I was asleep. All I wanted in the past year and a half was to talk to her. And I missed it by like 15 minutes. I responded to her text, But no luck. For the first time in over a year my text went through as delivered. This gave me a sense of hope that I had not experienced in my entire life. For the first time since our break up, I felt happy. 

Shortly after I texted her twice, my number was blocked again. Both texts were telling her I was sad to inform her of her friends passing. Since the response was made in entire day I called her. She blocked me again.

Fast forward a few days and I found out she’s engaged. I still love her more than anything. We had a rough patches and in all honesty, she was physically, mentally and emotionally abusive at times. But I can’t get my head around this. I beat the shit out of head the other night against a stud in a wall till I passed out. I woke up in a pool of blood, a massive cut down my head and mass confusion. 

For the first time in over a year (the second before I thought I was going to faint into death, I felt peace). I woke up to my dog licking the blood of my head and did t know anything. Where I was, whose dog that was, notching, but I did remember my ex and frantically calling to no avail. 

As a previous contributor to this page, I’m not seeking advice or help. Other than ways to leave more peacefully. My credit is shot, I’m loaded to the ground with student loans (private and government) all in undergrad and I spent every dollar from my inheritances building a relationship with this girl. 


Now that’s she’s Engaged, I’m left hopeless, broken and looking for a way to escape. The problems run deeper, so again. Please help someone leave this place. We need to cut down  on pollution and everything. I’d gladly save the world some oxygen. ",,Depressed

"I was born with one of the worst fucking genetic combinations ever and it depresses the shit out of me.I was 86 kilos at the beginning of the year, and 6'1. I had a very chubby face so I decided to cut weight down to 77 kilos. Now according to my gym machine I'm 12.2% bodyfat. That being said, my face is STILL chubby.

Another thing that sucks is my recessed chin. In case you don't know what a recessed chin is, have a look at this:

Notice how it goes behind my lips? It's very short compared to the rest of my face?

I have about $20,000 saved up through trading Bitcoin, and I put that in Apple stocks recently so it should hopefully grow. I plan to get extensive surgery from Barry Eppley and have been communicating with him recently, he says that his jawline implants and chin augmentation surgery can give me a less misshapen face. However, I still feel like it might not work at all. I can literally afford the plastic surgery right now but my mom won't let me get it, I have the bloody money... guess I'll have to wait almost 2 years then. I don't know if I can.

EDIT: A lot of people say ""oh just get braces"" but braces only fix your chin if you have an underbite.

"Bad thoughts.I'm 25 years old. I've always been a somewhat solitary and introverted person, but in the last year or so I feel that I have really hit rock bottom. There is no love in my life. The very few close friends that I have are in the process of outgrowing me as they establish their careers and get married. I just got back from a night out with them where I might as well have been invisible. I haven't been able to relate to anyone in my family in years. I just spend a lot of time with negative thoughts in my head and have been unemployed for about 2 years. I can't connect or look anyone in the eye when I'm out in public and on the off chance that I even try, the self doubt that I experience is crippling. I feel best immediately after the runs that I go on, but those moments are fleeting.

My living situation is disfunctional. It's just me and my mom in a big house, so I at least get some privacy. I try to tell myself that it's her fault how my life has turned out and I hate myself for it. Even the most insignificant interactions that I have with her just piss me off irrationally. I never had a stable social life as I was growing up. I had 4 older siblings who all moved out for college by the time I was cognizant of the fact that my mom and dad never spoke to each other. I was forced to switch schools several times and I never recovered. Since then my circle of friends has gotten increasingly smaller and it's gotten to the point where I just don't trust people with my feelings anymore. I know that it sounds extremely petty for me to be so fixated on something that many people face at some point, but if I had to pick a moment in time... I spend a lot of time just browsing the facebook pages of people that I knew in high school and seeing how practically everyone I've ever known has surpassed me in every way imaginable unless they're a corpse. Tonight I deactivated my fb account out of frustration, but I have a feeling that this will just add to my isolation.

The world is just passing me by. I don't think I accomplished a single thing all last year and it's fucking depressing. I'm currently in the process of finishing my education at a fifth tier college. When I think about my options for success, which at this point would just be not living in a basement, the one thing that always comes to my mind is enlisting in the military and getting myself killed in a pointless war to spare my family from the shame of a suicide. Most people would probably tell me to just man the fuck up, and I realize that my issues are 100% mental. It's just impossible to get anything done when I feel worthless all the time.

"Need some criticism Okay so this originally started out as a free write I wrote during school that I decided to go more in depth with. I’m curious what I can improve so far.




I walked into the village expecting merchants trading, animals running around, people just enjoying their lives. Nothing. No people, no wildlife, even the plants were wilting. I knew something wasn’t right. Even the most barbaric of orcs and the most mischievous of spirits would’ve left some trace behind. After exploring the desolate area for quite some time, I came upon a large wooden building. The town hall, I assumed. I figured that there had to be some clues as to what happened. The area inside showed no sign of damage, almost like everyone just decided to leave. The only thing that showed any life was a tapestry of a wizard bravely falling in combat against a manticore. The coldness of the air pierced my side. A knot formed itself in my stomach, my blood running cold. “Pull yourself together, you’re better than this, you’ve never backed down before, so why now?”, I thought. “You’ve dealt with plenty before, cyclopes to jinn, what’s so bad about th- “, my thought was interrupted as the sounds of marching filled my head. I quickly hid near a window to see what arrived. The sounds of snickering and growling, Goblins. Yet they looked as perplexed as I was. “Why aren’t we using the tunnels?”, said one goblin. “I’ve heard rumors of a defenseless town that has a secret path leading to a tressure filled castle, so I thought it was ripe for the taking but I never thought it’d be this easy. Besides, last time we used the tunnels, we headed into Dwarf central, literally.”. said the one in the front. I pulled my bow and arrow and readied my shot, waiting to see if force was necessary. The goblins stopped right in their tracks and began to sniff the air. The dozen or so goblins all turned to my direction, making my heart pump loud enough that they could surely hear it. One goblin began to charge at the town hall only to jolt to a stop. Goblins are known to be quite difficult to scare, some would even call them stupid or fearless, but the look of fear and confusion on the goblin’s face as his body was contorted against his will showed me that even the toughest warriors can crack. I hid there watching as his arms flail, his legs twist and turn, his torso bend at odd angles, the sounds of bones snapping and flesh mashing, all while he screamed in agony. His body began to float as his comrades screamed in terror, desperately trying anything to help him. The yells and cries for help from the goblin suddenly stopped as his body went limp. A hooded figure materialized with their hand in the goblin’s back, dropping it to the ground with some type of mist flowing to their hand. As the goblins stared in disbelief, the hooded figure spoke one word, “Sumegruser”. Skeletal hands rose from the ground and held down the goblins. The hooded figure approached them as their screams echoed throughout the village, the only sound heard for miles. Some type of necromancer, I knew I was not prepared to deal with one this skilled. I turned around and prayed to every god I knew of that I would make it out in one piece, and slowly crept towards a window on the left. I realized that the hooded figure would likely hear me try to get away, so I grabbed a chair and threw it through a window on the right. The hooded figure turned towards the noise and repeated the phrase, skeletal hands rose and grabbed the chair. I jumped through the window and raced out of the village, expecting to be grabbed by hands at any moment. My heart felt like it was bursting out of my chest, barely able to calm myself. I felt lost in the nearby forest, everything looking the same. The screams of the goblins still ech6ed though the area, making the area feel unescapable. After running through the seemingly endless forest, I began to feel the adrenaline leave my body as I came across a body of water. As I began to pass out from exhaustion near the water, I heard someone say a single word, “Mullebal”. Cold boney hands rose from the water and dragged me in, tightening an unearthly grip on me. Water gushed into my lungs, I could feel the life draining out of me, like I was the prey to a constrictor. I had to act fast, I could just faintly see the figures dragging me into the depths. Skeletal warriors dressed in all types of gear. From villager tunics to cleric robes, I began to ponder how many lives this necromancer has claimed and reanimated. “Focus! You don’t have much time!”, I thought. My eyes wandered around the murky abyss, searching for anything I could use to escape. At last, my eyes found something. A rune barely held together, attached to the cleric’s robes. I hastily unsheathed my sword and slashed wildly, breaking many of the undead warrior’s bodies. Just as quickly as they broke, their bodies reformed and began to drag me down again. The cleric was closer this time, in arm’s reach. As best as I could, I lunged forward and grabbed the rune, speedily turning the pages. I could barely read the incantation, but I had no other option. Water flooded into my mouth as I read the spell aloud. “THORON!”, I yelled. A bolt of lightning struck the skeletons, completely vaporizing them, while also hitting me. Never thought about how much pain divine electricity could bring, never want to experience that again. “Those potions better be as effective as they advertise.”, I thought. I slowly began to float towards the surface, wishing I had never gone to the village. I peeked my head above the water and was greeted by the night sky. The goblin screams seemed to have stop while I was underwater, so I assumed the worst. I crawled onto the shore, coughing up water constantly. I wandered randomly through the woods, barely able to tell anything apart. The attempted drowning certainly did not help me physically recover. Sleep seemed so enticing, just a moment to rest my head…”NO!”, I screamed. I realized how stupid that was, both falling asleep and yelling, probably alerting everything in the area. I stumbled throughout the maze-like forest, barely conscious. Joy and hope came to me as I came across a quiet village, only for both to be extinguished as I realized I went in a circle right back to the village. With no other options, I crept around the ghost town, making sure to be as quiet as possible. I thought perhaps that tapestry had some secrets to reveal, maybe even what happened to the town. I quietly snuck into the town hall, ready to run at the sight of the necromancer, only to find everything as it had been. Lurking towards the tapestry, I could clearly see that the tapestry was meant to hide something. I quietly removed the tapestry, finding a dark tunnel. “This must be what the goblins were talking about.”. I thought to myself. I stared into the seemly endless abyss, wondering what mysteries were hidden there. I grabbed a torch off the fall and used some flint to light it.",,Anxious

I never had crushes either.. and I often think to myself that many people who are married are just unhappy. They get into fights over dumb things constantly. And just see the 'I hate my wife' boomer memes. If you really loved someone, you wouldn't joke about this, right?

Then work/school: For me school is the worst thing ever, I suffer daily when going there. And I had hope it may get better when I'll get into the 'real' life. And then every adult tells you that it's only gonna get worse from now on and they wish they'd still be in school. If it's only gonna get worse from now on, why bother thinking that you'll be happy later in life?

And of course with age come a lot of problems like pain. Back pain due to bad posture for example, then constant headaches etc.
My posture is the worst thing in the world. It's so bad and I'm already looking forward to the massive pains it'll give me.

But even with all this, I don't care anymore. I used to worry but I don't anymore. Life will suck and there's nothing I can do about it. I don't care anymore.

One guy questioned the likelihood of my, as I know it entirely normal, bit rough but normal, life story. Another wanted to know where I got my diagnosis. A third said he couldn't read the whole thing or comment, but he was sure someone else would (he was mistaken). And now I get it. The stuff, it really does taint you, make you a bad person. So I am going to put my story here. I do not know why, with this preface and any addendum, it is quite long, doubtful anybody actually reads it. Or cares. But this is my shitty, meaningless story.

Hello. I am new here, but I thought I would share a a bit of my story. I came onto Reddit three months ago for the survivor subs. I have been in therapy five months, and it has helped a great deal. I never sought any help before, I had one bad experience with therapy a decade ago, and never went back, I didn't figure I was helpable. I am thirty seven, and have autism and PTSD, as well as the depression and anxiety, though those are getting better. When I was growing up, things were difficult. My father was a heroin addict and career criminal, and back then, my mother was the type of quiet girl who would not say shit. We moved thirty one times in my first eighteen years. When I was eight I was raped on five occasions by a man.

It was the point the bullying started to get really bad, they would punch, kick, throw stones, lock you inside things. I found a spot, a clearing in the woods, to hide. It was a tiny rural town, and I read detective stories, I figured out that the lack of detritus boys leave, little toys and whatnot, meant the other boys had not found this place. I went back to the spot maybe fifty or sixty times over that summer. He just showed up randomly five times, some farmer or something, I will never know. I would get so involved in my book, encyclopedia brown and Nancy Drew at that point, I did not notice him approaching until he was right there.

The first time, he only took off my clothes and fingered me. Afterword, he talked. About what a bitch his ex wife was, about some other boy he molested, about work. He made a very convincing case for why I should not tell, that my family would be broken up and us all placed in care, and this would happen more and be worse there. The second time he raped me orally. The third through fifth time were worse, he took me each way then, orally, from behind, on top like a girl, talking about his personal shit in between until he was ready again.

The fourth and fifth time he took pictures with an old polaroid camera. Get in this position and that, etc. I started acting out at home, though I never told anyone. I set a fire and I panicked, but I got it out. I broke some windows of a building, stole a pop from a store, and popped a blow up pool of a smaller girl. I still feel bad about that one, the way she cried. My parents knew the autism was a thing, though what it was, the name, they did not yet know. So they sent me to a live in hospital for six months. I was going to tell someone there, a kindly teacher figure, but the circumstances scared me. There were ten kids in our unit, and they treated most of us nice, but there was a girl, and they were not nice to her. Not unprofessional, just cold and robotic. She was bad, she would run away, grab the men sexually, she was eleven but it would take four grown men to restrain her safely. She used teeth and hands as claws.

She would tell trauma stories in hideous detail, laughing with a bitterness I have rarely heard in an adult. I was the only one she would talk to. I just got it, I mostly listened, I was still, and I never ever touched her. After six months, soon after I turned nine, they talked to me about going home. They left it up to me, but I was so excited, I did not think of her. When she heard, she locked herself in her room for a week. They needed all manner of threats to get her to come out and eat, at the end they simply refused to feed her if she did not come to the dining room.

So she did, and pushed a chair against a wall of the dining romm and stared at it, looking at nobody. I never saw her again. When I was eleven my uncle and cousin, who were thirty and nine, died in a housefire. Though our house was imperfect, the judge figured with a husband, wife and three kids, it was better for my surviving cousin, who was seven, to live with us rather than his mother, who was a kind lady, but a bad drunk. Dad treated him very badly, him and his brother had been very close, but he hated his wife, and they had rarely seen each other in the last five years. Dad seemed to take this out on the cousin.

He always treated him worse, assumed worse of him. He was a firm believer in spanking for me and my two younger sisters, but he rarely beat us. He beat him like a rag doll. This was made more so by the cousin being a fighter, a tough kid always getting into trouble. Later the year I was eleven, my father and an uncle burned our house down as an insurance scam. They got away with it, he sent us to stay the night at a friends house. Then called us out to see it, the whole family, to watch the fire trucks and the house burn.

The cousins hand in mine squeezing, his fear, is not something I can forget. After three years the cousin's mother got better, and he moved with her. Dad never let us see him again, and I only reconnected with him through facebook three years ago. My parents divorced at twelve, and my mother got with a prick who took emotional abuse to a new level. The bullying continued apace until fourteen, and the schools added zero tolerance policies. I was molested again when I was thirteen. We had a house on the beach, poor though we were, dad always seemed to be able to talk himself into good things, and I would walk up the beach miles, I liked long walks.

It was a public bathroom, it was very early morning, and there was nobody around. He simply shoved me in a stall, shoved his hands down my pants, and fiddled around. He told me that I was lucky I didn't get hard or he would have raped me, and left. When I was fifteen, dad got bad. He had bought us kids fine bedroom sets, fine beds, dressers, a television set, a super nintendo etc. One day we got home and everything was gone, replaced by the cheapest charity versions of what we had had.

He got worse, became suicidal. and sent us to live with an aunt, he went across the country to get clean. He didn't, and the aunt grew tired of us kids, getting rid of the one sister after two months, the other after four, and me after six. When I got to the big city my father and two sisters were living in, it was a gang riddled slum. He had had many people living in the house, my sisters will not talk about anything that happened in those months. There was nothing in the apartment, a mattress the girls shared, some clothes, a couch and coffee table, nothing else. My mother had moved to that side of the country since, and I phoned everybody.

About a month after I got there, she kidnapped us technically to regain custody. We were living in that part of the country when I turned sixteen. That was the last time I was molested. I walked four miles to a mall, and was tired walking back and took a ride. The guy fiddled around, same as before, and called it fare for the ride. During those years there was constant partying, wild drug parties, in the house. There were other fires, suicides, and OD's. When I was eighteen, living back in the town I am in now, me and my father got an apartment together as adult roommates.

During that my favorite uncle died in a drunken car crash, and a sweet old man I knew well, I sat in his house dozens of times to buy dope for dad, got stabbed to death over an attempt to steal twelve beers. That lasted four and a half years, but dad was a heroin addict, and one day I got up and he was stone dead. I was twenty two. I moved a hundred miles north six months later, to a town I had lived in and had a friend. I was OK for quite a few years, moved a lot, and poor, but I made friends, mostly by dealing grass, but still. At twenty eight I got a place with a friend. We lived together five years.

The first two were good, but the third got hard, and the last two were bad. He had schizophrenia, and I have autism. We started being gay, kinda. Spooning, kissing, hugging. But I could not be gay for him. I loved him, I tried to dredge up gay feelings sexually, looked at gay porn, but I just could not be that for him. The last two years it was awful. Hiding in rooms, banging on doors, constant yelling and sniping. threatening suicide, potential suicide pacts. In the last six months it got worse. The med changes stopped working, he started thinking people were coming into the apartment, watching in cars outside, hearing things.

It was when he started seeing UFO's I realized this was hurting him. I gave him two months notice, but he was so mad. He would not discuss me helping him get a place, just blew up. At the last two weeks he gpt scared of homelessness and begged me to find him a place. I did not know what to do. I have so little, with a bit more time it would have been easier, I found him a cottage in the nest town over where I would be living, but he did not want to leave the town because of his mother.

So all I could find him was a room in a boarding house. It was an awful place. We kept talking for a month, but at that point, he was at his mothers when I visited, I visited every day, taking the link bus between towns. He told me never to contact him again, not to cry in front of his mother, it was over. When someone says that, decent society says to obey that, so I did not contact him. A month after that, he had pushed a dresser in front of the door of his room in the boarding house, and was on his meds, and set himself on fire sleeping.

He lived, but him and another man were badly burned.After a month he was released from the hospital, and I did visit his mothers once more. She said she had always liked me, took my contact info, but said he would never contact me. She was right, he never did. After that, I began drinking quite heavily. I do not know if the drinking caused the memories from childhood that I thought I had dealt with or what. Over the next four years of everyday drunkenness I fucked up everything. Lost most of my friendships, became a sad whining idiot.

At that point, a year ago I jumped off a bridge. That was the point I decided to get help. Things are getting better, addiction counseling for ten months, therapy for five. I am two credits from finishing highschool, getting my drivers license, got my first part time job. Three weeks ago I was layed off from my job until September, and my therapist is taking literally nothing until then, with both of us simply assuming and hoping I do in fact get my job back. Anyway, this is long, but I wanted to tell the basic core of my story. Thank you so very much to anybody who reads this.

In any case, I go to therapy in half an hour. I feel pretty bad right now, and the bad thoughts keep spinning. But no doubt I will be fine. I will keep working. But I cannot keep a false confidence forever. If the goals we, the social worker and therapist and I, talk about, are bullshit to give me hope, so I can be a less depressive complaining person, stop bothering others in my life, it worked. I no longer talk about my sadness or anger with anybody, and can now keep my pain inside. 

I have been helped by therapy. But I am gaining a sneaking suspicion that this is they core of it. Learn how to shut up about your personal problems. Which is fine, it makes sense and is right. People really should not have to have you put your stuff on them. But I do know if I do something to myself in the future, all this therapy stuff has taught me that. If you truly feel that way, people would prefer I just do it quietly and be done with it. ",,Depressed

What makes me depressed is my whole life, who I am, what iv'e done, how friends and colleges pity me and feel sry for me. My family, my upbringing, stuff i've said, stuff i've done. Before I was oblivious to all these things but i've been made aware of all this. This has made me lose my shit. I dropped out of university, I stoped hanging out with my friends. My plan was to just deplet all my cash on food and alcohol and then commit suicide.

"The time i beat the school bully in wii tennis Im on a long car ride so i thought id share this here.

Backround: im pretty good at wii tennis, i mean, im better at that game then any other game ive ever played. I can beat everyone i play in wii tennis. And yes this is a flex, but it is necessary.

Backround pt2: last year before summer on our tech class, the room was under construction, and we coulnt really do anything so the teacher set up 2 wiis on the two huge projectors.

Backroundpt3: so there is this dude who isnt exactly a bully, but he is your stereotypical douche-y type. Most people dont like this kid because he is just kind of an ass. Our school doesn't really have bullies, and this is the closest thing to one.

So there we all are, messing around in this big room and playing wii. Me and the friends i had in that class decides to hop on the wii, and i start beating everyone as usual, and on the other wii the douche kid, lets call him frank Sinatra, is on the other wii doing pretty good as well. So he starts talking smack and challenges me to a classic wii tennis duel. 

At the beggining of the game im doing pretty good. I was serving first and i can get the fast serve most times. (I beilive the game has a limit to how many fast serves in a row is possible)
I win the first round. Still talking shit, frank doesnt seem to faded quite yet seems to be getting worried. 

Returning fast serves isnt my strong point, and i lose round 2.

Round 3 comes, the smack talking continues like no other. Half the class is watching now, and all my friends are cheering for me. I know that i cant lose this match. This kid is already an ass, and i would never live this down. I had to win.

The end of round 3 was nearing now, and we are tied up stuck in a deuce. We all watch as the score goes back and forth, up and down. Never in my life have i been more stressed. For those who havent played wii tennis in 8 years, you can get to a point where you must score two points in a row to win, or it will default back to a tie. 

We are stuck in this stage for what feels like hours, both of us start to get worse and worse as we tire out.


Then it happens. Im one point ahead, i serve the ball up, i watch as it hits the top pixel. The world moves slow as i whip the controller, the final pitch needed, i hit the perfect fast ball, frank returns it, but the ball flies into the stands. I had done it! I had beaten the shithead. 

I slept good that night, and the memory comforts mebto this day.

"I feel like I don't deserve anything anymoreBasically, that happened when I was 14-15. 

There was this guy in my classroom: he was quite awkward, didn't really cure himself, had a strange way of spelling some letters, got angry quite easily and was let's say.. naive. 

The 14/15 years old be who wanted to act cool thought he was funny, so I'd often make fun of him. I wasn't really insulting him, but rather I was being a jerk: I would imitate his speech, I would ask him for jokes that I already knew that weren't funny just for that cringy situation that would come out as a result, and made stupid jokes. I was being silly, making stupid stories that I thought were funny, and even if I didn't mean it to directly offending him or shit, I'm sure I did, and I'm sure I tormented him. It must have not felt good. 

At the time I felt like after all I didn't offend him, and he kind of did nothing for that by not accepting the joke and having fun. I was a dickhead.

Now I have apologized to him and he forgave me, but I feel like it's not enough. I feel like this is a burden I have to take with me for the rest of my life. I also feel like all in all I'm just a selfish bastard, who is apologizing not only for him but for a relief. 

And this thing really made my dreams, my thoughts of the person I am and all just disappear. I'm hopeless and I feel like I deserve it. It feels bad. 

And there's so many people out there who really have no mercy of bullies and I can't really put the blame on them. I'm not sure myself I'd forgive my bullies as well, as their stupid apologies won't bring back my tears, my happiness and my self esteem back.

At the moment of ejaculation the walls of the epididymis contract (squeeze) to create peristaltic waves that push sperm into the vas deferens. Nerves also stimulate the seminal vesicles and the prostate to contract which forces semen (the mixture of sperm and secretions) into the urethra.

"3 trips to hospital in 2 monthsWell, I never expected to be in a psych ward twice, let alone once in my life. But then who would have thought I would have debilitating depression and anxiety? 

Long story short, I got admitted 11/11, exactly 2 months from 9/11. I had a panic attack before an exam and took 3 mg klonopin at once instead of 1 mg twice daily. I was off balance (still am actually) and sounded drunk. I went to the ER where they cleared me. 

Except that maybe this would have been an attempt. It was to help my anxiety, sure, but I wanted to experiment what the overdose effects would be. I wanted to talk 4 mg but only did 3 because I would scared. 

I feel like this will be my life in an unending cycle until I die. First it was just fleeting thoughts. Then anxiety, then bad depression with suicide thought, then self harming and actually carrying out an action. I just know it will get worse until I kill myself and this won’t be the last time at the psych ward",,Depressed

"I want to move out asap Living at home sucks for me. For years I have wanted to escape from this hellhole called home. There are many reasons why:

1. I'm 18 and many people my age are moving to dorms/apartments and I will eventually have to do that anyway so I can become an independent person. I don't want to end up like some random 40 year old still stuck in his parents' basement.

2. My family is weird af. My parents pamper me too much and I have a little brother who does absolutely nothing but play video games all day. And the family also has a cat that I'm afraid could attack me at any moment. And I'm afraid that they could judge me at any moment. No wonder I really want to live by myself or a roommate.

3. My room is small as fuck and gets messy really easily. My major requires me to purchase a lot of big equipment and my room simply doesn't have the space for that. Even worse is that I want to move some stuff into the closet but my mom has clothes there and refuses to move them. Also the walls are green and blue and the lights are yellow and it's wayyy too colorful.

4. My house doesn't have a pool and neither does the neighborhood, while all the other apartment complexes in my town have pools. Man I wish I could just go change into my bathing suit one day and take a swim one day when I have free time, without having to drive miles to a public pool when it could be just a walk away. No wonder I want to move out asap.

Well, the only thing preventing me from moving out is that I don't have a car or a driver's license. But since I'm taking driver lessons and saving up for a car by working my job I think it's possible that I could move out within the next year.

"My life is the definition of insanity.My friend even told me so. I keep doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different result. March I lost my fiance when he fell in love with another girl after we moved into a new apartment together. I started drinking again after that. I dropped out of school. I was stuck living with him because I had helped pay for that apartment and was broke from doing so. $2000 down the drain. He started to become mentally, emotionally, and physically abusive. I was broken and still am. Then my friend offered me an escape. Move into his apartment with him and his son. However, I was never able to recover. My drinking is now to the point where I am going to lose everything. My job is hanging in by a thread and I cry every day. I cry before work, during work, and after work. The only thing that stops me from feeling like crying is drinking. It is the only way I can get through a day without feeling so bad. But, this past week and a bit it has somehow managed to get even worse. My room mate bailed out on August 28th. He basically said he was going to be going to London for work for the weekend. He then proceeds to tell me that we are losing the apartment. I went out drinking that Friday and haven't stopped. I cry all the time. 

I am sure my bosses know that my life is unraveling. My work isn't the same. I don't see the point. I don't find pleasure in anything. I am sitting in front of my TV right now and can't find any pleasure in watching TV. I am ruining relationships with people. I am not sure how aware people around me are, but it is just so hard to not want to run away from it all.  Even now I just feel like crying. I don't have any alcohol and don't plan on buying anymore. It is only a temporary bandage. It is a crap coping mechanism. I have lost 5lbs this week alone because I have no desire to eat. I can't sleep and ALL I want to do is sleep or cry. Even as I type this I am crying. I just want something to go right in my life. I just want normalcy. I can't even afford to rent this place, but I have no where else to go. I am just so tired of this. What is the point? I think about killing myself every day. I thought about it in the bathtub earlier. Just sitting there, being a sad excuse for an individual.

Fast forward a couple months I get really into my Science Olympiad team and we actually made it to the state competition... and then Coronavirus cancelled it 4 days before actual competition, not that big of a deal right?

I had very long hair, my mom cut it, now I have mid-longhair She said I looked like a homeless, a hobo

My dad said she was right
I wasnt Happy about it
It's not only about my hair, it's also because they shamed me a lot because I told them some lies about University in the beginning, I said time ago that I did an exam but It wasnt true, I lied because I was afraid of telling them that I didnt want to study

I can understand that they got angry but they shame me a lot, my mom said awful things about me, those words came from a moment of anger but they still affect me

The day after this shit, I receive a call for a job, what a coincidence, I accepted and I'm starting in June
Dont know if I'll continue studying

"I’m contemplating suicide.Throwaway Account.

I am contemplating suicide. 

I just don’t see the point in life, what is the point if living life when it’s so painful? I’ve suffered from depression all my life, looking back, I suffered with it from a very young age, I have a nephew who is turning 7 soon and it makes my stomach turn when I look at him, how can an innocent child have such thoughts of hopelessness and anxiety at that age. I didn’t have a bad childhood but definitely a lonely one, I had my ass beat a few times by my brother which I think about sometimes but honestly nothing major. I’ve reached out for help and I’m currently on a waiting list for counselling that I referred myself for, 6 months waiting list and I have been put on medication from my MH nurse. 

Socially, I’m relatively normal, you wouldn’t guess it looking at me as I’m often “life of the party”, quite chatty and have a lot of banter at work but when I come home, I am a broken person. I’ve had a lot of people in my life that have just thrown me away, I’ve always been quite disposable of a person, I’ve had things happen to me that shouldn’t have, and I’ve knowingly let people take advantage of me and use me, probably because of my self-esteem. So many people have let me down and done shitty things to me that it’s now apparent I am the problem, you can’t go through life blaming other people, there must be a reason why it always happens to me. Nobody wants me and it’s probably all my fault. I’ve had enough, I’ve been thinking about that a lot, I think the only people who would really care are my mum and dad, I’d leave them my savings and a letter explaining, they’d just be so much better off. 

I have had a lot of heart break lately, stress at work with a grievance I have put in about a member management bullying me, rejection. I’m a mess.

"stuckI feel like i'm backed against a wall. Painfully aware of the devastating effects suicide has on family and friends due to a young family member recently succeeding in an attempt. I have been in a mess before, seems to happen every year and a half, and I really thought I was in a position where I could control myself, but I'm losing it. 

I recently had to move out of a flat because an apparent friend got into my bed while I was asleep, and I woke up to him touching me. I have spiralled since this and become isolated from all my old friends because they are all in the same social group and I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore.

I've had to move back in with my parents, where i'm sleeping on a sofa and have no personal space. I've jumped through every hoop I know from previous episodes of depression. I've been signed off work and I feel like they are all wondering why I've been off for weeks. I can't breathe in this house. I had been staying at my boyfriends every night to get away but he went on holiday today and he was my line of support. I had been referred to a psychologist but he cut the session short because he said he felt like I was becoming more stressed by his suggestions than it was a help to me. I'm back at stage one. I have just run out of fight and it feels like noone can help me. 

I feel like I have no grounding and I don't know who I am or what I should be doing with my life. The state of emotional distress i'm in is the most acute I have ever experienced and it feels unjustified. I've seen my GP, they've been swapping my pills around to try and get me back on my feet. I'm an adult but my mother grew up with me being unstable and she breathes down my neck at the first sign, especially after the loss of said family member. I feel absolutely suffocated and I have planned a trip away by myself the day after tomorrow, and I know the only option I have is to go to the hospital and admit I am a danger to myself. If I do that I know i'll end up in a facility again and I absolutely can't stand the thought of my family becoming aware of the severity of the situation. I have numbers i'm supposed to call but i'm surrounded by people and there is no way I can do that. 

This has been snowballing for months and I'm exhausted and i'm becoming a massive drain on my boyfriend but I feel like I can't breathe, that I have no escape route and it just isn't going to end. I don't know why being awake is so painfully unbearable right now and now my boyfriend is not here my will to carry on is becoming pathetic and I'm scared of myself.

I have no friends here and my life is literally work then come home to my family. My mum is an alcoholic and whenever I come to visit her she just spends her time In the pub, I refuse to drink because of how much she and my dad drunk when I was young so I like to avoid them really. My dad cares about me so much that I move 400 miles to see him but he just fucked off somewhere else again anyway and finally my family the best thing that’s happened to me seems to be on the verge of a break up because Im a complete shit head and can’t control my anger in a positive way. Also I’m riddled with fucking debt.

"I am not doing this again.I live in Italy. Due to my very very poor motivation I will have to repeat second year of high school for the third time. I am a disappointment to everyone around me and I know that if I did it they would probably be happy. That boy wasn’t going to accomplish anything anyways. Everyone is laughing behind my back, that donkey, how could he be so stupid to not manage such a simple thing like going to school and just getting average grades?
Killing myself looks like the best option. I will not have a third opportunity. Not that I would take it anyways. But it’s all my fault. School is easy anyways, I just have to study an hour a day. But no, my brain is so stupid and has such a short attention span that anything that does not give me instant gratification is not considered. I probably have undiagnosed ADD. my boy? How could he be HANDICAPPED???? They are so ignorant and not sensitive. They don’t notice strange behaviors in people and if they do, they are too indifferent to talk about it or help. My dad died a month ago. He was such a nice person. I loved him with all my heart, he was similar to me. He destroyed himself with alcohol and smoking. But he was smart. During his “golden days” (before I came and ruined everything) he was an architect. He was an engineer and he was brilliant and known. Then it all crumbled. I am like my dad, but the golden days never came. And they never will. Something is wrong with me. I may have under average intelligence. I am sorry. I have never been good at anything. Average at best. Swimming? Cost us a lot of money and I never got good at it. Volley? Same. Music? Same. I am only good at computer games. I spend all day at my pc. Playing those STUPID games. But it’s not their fault. It’s my fault. Only mine. I may also be on the autism spectrum. I show a lot of signs. I can’t look people in the eyes. I am ankward. Everyone treats me like a fucking dumbass. But on paper I am normal. Fuck you. Fuck you mom. You never even noticed I had flat feet. Now it’s too late to do anything. But I guess I can play csgo, right? My dad bought that pc. It cost him more than he makes in two months. He hoped I would use it to study better and get better at school. But no. I disappointed him. I stopped going at his house to see him. He started drinking again. I ghosted him. He called me every week. He asked if I could come for lunch. Every week he sounded less lucid. His liver was failing. The day before he went to the hospital (died a week later) he called me to his house to help me study. He could barely stand up and his words were hard to comprehend. His body was full of ammonia and it was getting to his brain. But he wanted to help me study. I killed him? Fuck. I am now realizing this and I feel like shit. No. Actually I don’t feel like anything. I also have depression. It has always been there. I am never happy. Never motivated, never sad. Just indifferent. I feel like a piece of wood in the ocean. I have no way to control where I’m going. The waves just move me around with no destination. I am deteriorating. Physically and mentally.
I am so sorry, about being so shit at everything. About disappointing everyone and not making good use of the opportunities that the world gave me. The opportunities are not going to present themselves anymore. Please I need someone to talk to. Comment or private chat.

"Dark thoughts showed up last night, never actually had these beforeI'm currently going through a rough patch of life. I think I've been dealing with low levels of depression for a while, but I haven't gone to see anyone about it since it wasn't unbearable and I felt like I was working through things ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, so the gist of what's going on in my life has been chronic pain that puts me through an injury cycle of injury, recovery, rebuild and repeat. My husband and I have been going through some rough spots in our marriage, and he works so much that I don't see him very often. I know his work is overwhelming him and that's why he seems so disconnected. But I sometimes take it personally. I've also lost most of my friends, so I spend a large amount of my time alone. My job (massage therapist) is isolating as well as I don't work with other therapists, and many times my clients don't want to chit chat so I spend most of my working days working quietly in a dark room as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend has been our biggest event of the year at work (country club, our biggest golf tournament) and I've been doing complimentary massage all weekend which is both physically and emotionally/energetically draining. Last night was the hardest of all the days and by the time I went home I was done. Husband worked late and then had agreed to meet up with a friend for drinks afterwards, so he came home around 2am way after I went to sleep. While I was laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep I suddenly had an urge to go to the bathroom and take all the naproxen I had left in the cabinet. The only thing that stopped me was knowing how upset my dog would be as he's very in tune with my emotions, and I'm his person.

&amp;#x200B;

I just looked up thoughts of suicide on google, as that urge has never been anything that I've ever experienced before and it was a little unsettling. The articles I found were all common sense, but I thought as someone in that state of mind, not very helpful. For example: you're not alone, you would cause grief to others, someone would miss you. Which, logically I know all this. But sometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice if I just disappeared. I'm not even close to actually doing anything to myself. And I think I might try to find myself a therapist and get some help. But it was so bizarre I needed to tell someone, and I have no one to tell.",,Depressed

"Today's day was a weird day, happened a lot of thing in a short time haha So all started in my house when my friend told me to come to the cyber cafe, a cyber cafe that it's in the other side of the city. He went there around 12 before I got there cuz he work there. Usually you get paid with money when you do a work, but he got a deal with the cyber cafe to get paid with screen time on the computer to play Leage of legends. 

I got there and we played valorant for about two hours where we won every single game. I still don't know how we won cuz both us suck at shooter, seems there's people sucks more that we do. 

When we left the cyber we were kinda lost on what to do so we just went to a park that was nearby. Its a pretty nice park, it has trees and green everywhere, I love it. that park was made as tribut to one of the greatest writers that ever born in argentina Jorge Luis Borges, but it's also known as the place teenagers smokes weed. 

So we got there and walk a little when we saw a bunch of girls blasting music and twerking together, that was pretty funny imo haha. Usually we just laugh and keep walking when we see something like that , but one of aggressively turns his head at my friend amd shouts ""SWEETHEART!"". I tell my friend ""yo get outta here"" and he says ""don't worry she's my friend, I know her for years"" so we did as he said and went with the suspicious twerking bunch of girls. 

When I got there they welcome us pretty nicely, more than I expected from there, BUT then one of her asked if we had money to buy alcohol to what I said I don't have any money, BUT (I hate buts) my friend sells me and say ""No DonT LiE yOu HaVe moNey"" those weren't his exacts words but that's what he ment to say. So I get bombed by request from alcoholics girls to lend them money. I give up trying to say I wouldn't give them money and lend them. I couldn't say no, they were really nice asides for them asking me money for vodka when they just met me for the first time.
Anyways they offered me with cookies wich I gladly accepted 

We talk for half an hour or so when one of them brings out something about some girls called Farfan and how she was talking, in a no so friendly way, to her boyfriend, SO ALL OF THEM AGREE IN FUCKING BEAT HER ASS. We when in a really long walk around the city in search of that girl to fucking beat her but we didn't found her and gave up looking for her. 

It was kinda raining that time so we just went all of us to a place where there are some super leafy trees that catch all the rain, basically a bigass natural umbrella. But when we got there, guess what? The mother fucking girl we were looking for was there 💀. 

All the girls were with us suddenly place in a kinda hidden and call the girl there and say something about how she posted a instagram story with her bf and how she put hearts and a 👉👈  emoji on it. Idk clearly what they told her cuz they were kinda far form me, but they both girls had the grudge rised ther arms and got in a fight position. My friend, that knew both girls and knew who would win, ask me to bet on them money.

I kinda don't want to describe the fight cuz it wasn't that exiting, they just grab their hair  and trew aimless slaps anywhere, dumb things girls does when they fight. The thing is that I lost the bet and my friend got the money, that means that he owes me less than before haha 

By that time the weather was getting worse, so everyone started going back the their house. Me and my friend went with them to their houses to say good bye the there except one that was the one that lived the furthest. 

We rest a little in idk how to call that place for a while were that girl sung some for use. She sings really well, has a voice so sweet haha. 

and when we were going to their house my friend had the idea to visit some artist aka tattooist that lived on the way there. He let us in his house, I really like it there was drawings all around his room and was so cool. 

We chilled some time there until that cute girl started to do make up on my friend. She put some red lipstick on him and did his eyelashes too, he looked like a girl lmao, kinda like his cute sister. Lmao my friend has alway been kinda lost with his sexuality and shit so he turned really weird with the make up, he said that when he saw himself in the mirror he had the urge to pose haha. He even borrowed that cute girl shirt and saw half a tiddie cuz she changed her shirt i  front of us haha. 

We got the the final! we went that girls to her house and all of us went their way to their houses; my friend still had his make up on. The day was intersting, truly a good and odd day 😌",,Anxious

"anyone else watched The Social Dilemma on Netflix? if you dont know, *The Social Dilemma* is a documentary film that exposes and talks about the dangers of social media and how manipulative it is, specifically with regards to fake news and how easily it can be distributed on places like facebook, reddit and twitter. 

if so, comment your thoughts, im interested.

personally, i loved it, but more so because it really 
opened my eyes. i think most of what they said is what most of us know anyway, but the more you think about it, the more you realise how huge of a problem social media really is. i also love how they incorporated a sort of short film into it, it helped keep the documentary more realistic and relatable, and kept my attention. 

and if you havent watched it, please, i urge you to. most of us here are most likely addicted to the internet and social media. believe me, i am too. its an amazing film that really shows how manipulative it is and how harmful it has been, and will be in the near future.

"I'm just so tired of being constantly scared of everythingI don't know what is wrong with me. I have never been diagnosed with anything. The only psychologist I have gone to said I am just introverted but I really doubt that.

I am turning 18 in March and my life currently consists of school and nothing else. I have no hobbies, no interests, no talents, no friends, no job and no personality at all. I can't change that because I am simply scared.

I can't talk to people because I constantly stutter. I also can't look them in the eyes for longer that a second. 

I feel super uncomfortable the moment I step out of my house. So scared of everything. Am I walking right? Are my clothes the right way? Maybe my mouth is open and I don't know. Maybe I'm staring at someone? What about my arms? Are they alright? Are they ""wiggling"" too much or too little? I'm looking to the left for too long now, better look the other way. 

It goes on when I get to class. I can't really focus on the topic because my mind is full of my scared thoughts. What if I'm breathing too loudly? Maybe I'm sitting in a weird position. Are my legs the right way? How are the other girls sitting? Fuck, she caught me staring. Fuck fuck fuck. Is she still looking at me? She is definitely looking at me. Quick, act like everything is fine!

I'm so tired of this. I want to get a job but there is no way. I'm scared what am I gonna do when I'm out of school. I also have no hobbies because I'm too scared to try. What if I fail? It's nothing important but I'm still scared of it. Right now I can tell myself that if I tried to cook something it might turn out fine, but if I actually tried and failed, this little hope would be gone. It's the same with everything else in my life. I'm just scared to do ANYTHING and don't know why. I don't wanna live. I'm literally useless, for the others as much as for myself. I want to do things, I don't want to just stare at the wall for 2 hours straight, but I can't. I just can't.

My mother thinks I'm making it up and I'm just lazy. She doesn't believe me when I say I simply can't live like other people. When I told her that I feel judged because of my ugly face - which I'm not trying to fix in any way, no makeup or anything, and I hate myself so much because of it - she says I'm just looking for attention and just want her to compliment me. When I said I feel like someone is always looking at me, she said I'm selfish for thinking that. And when I told her I want to die, she literally opened the window and told me ""come on, jump then"". And I didn't. I was too scared.

I still want to die and still am too scared to do it. It scares that I might not succeed and it also scares me that I might.

About 5 years ago my life was great. I had a home of my own, I had friends that were not on the internet, I had just began dating a guy i met online and it was going great. then about 4 years ago I married the guy I was dating, 2 weeks after the wedding I fell pregnant. From there on my life has rapidly gone downhill. From the moment my son was concieved i have had nothing but health issue after health issue. I suffered with Postpartum depression and struggled for a year to overcome, just to find myself back into a black pit of self loathing. After my son turned a year old I had a breast cancer scare which tuned out to be cyst. then over the the course of the time since then to now i've been diagnosed with SS &amp; Fibromyalgia. I can't work because im always in horrible pain, im depressed and i've had enough. I just want to end my life. 

tonight I told my best friend that if they hadn't walked back into my life i would probably be dead already and to walk back out of my life and let me go. all I do is fuck everything up. I just want to end my life, I wan't to go to sleep and never wake up again. I wan't everyone I know to just stop caring about me. I dont deserve to be cared about. I dont deserve to be loved.

I’m under 16 that’s all I’m gonna say about my age for non doxxing purposes. My friend introduced her to me a few months ago and we talked a decent amount but not a lot. This last month we have talked more (shit gets weird from here on out) she has always been pretty edgy. I once watched a screenshare of her on the dark web watching gore and was totally normal about it. She has told me how she was molested by her abusive father and her moms a druggie so there’s that. Fast forward to today, sometimes I’ll jokingly simp for her it gets the whole squad laughing. So during one of my simp jokes she had a woman in the backround moaning (she is bi btw) we thought it was her but turns out she was fingering someone while talking to us. She said if I called her daddy she’ll show me her fingering someone (me being the comedian I am called her daddy as a joke not expecting anything. She ends up showing her fingering someone, I tell her to confirm it by having both people but a thumbs up, YEP TWO THUMBS UP.  After that disturbing yet funny incident I ask her why she would show that to someone online. She replied it’s gonna be her last night of her life. Chills have ran down my spine now and I’m pretty worried. I’m not gonna tell her to not do it because her life is pretty fucked up and I know how ANNOYING it is for people to tell you shit like “don’t do it you have so much to live for” but I don’t encourage it either I stay mostly neutral. She says she is gonna walk to a bridge 8 miles away with a beautiful view and jump off it. She doesn’t have a car so I offered to talk to her for like 2 hours during her walk to it. She said yes and told me how much of a good person I am which really warmed my heart. I know for a fact she is gonna kill her self so I’m not trying to stop her at all. She messages me that when she is about to jump she wants me to say that I love her when she jumps. Of course I agree she needs everything she can get right now and I’m the only one who is on to talk to her. She also just told me she cried and cuddled with her gf. Since then she hasn’t responded for like 2 hours. She also said she needed to charge her phone so she could talk to me while she goes to the bridge. So bright side her gf talked to her and she won’t do it, dark side she killed herself or OD’d she was on a not so legal drug she told me. Maybe her phone is still charged she is not online on disc and sometimes she’s on do not disturb. So I’m really confused on what to do here. And I’ve only known her for a few months so I can’t tell her to not kill herself.",,Depressed

"please help meThis is going to be long winded if I ever finish it at all, so I'm sorry for that.

Obviously since I'm posting in SW you can assume that I feel pretty fucking awful. I've made a few SW posts and deleted them immediately thereafter out of pure embarrassment and self hatred for even considering to call for help, and maybe that's an issue in itself. I don't know. But I just want to give you a little bit of insight unto my life, as I experience it, and maybe get some help for it. Although inside I know this whole process isn't going to do much for me at all. 

I've been depressed - numb, separated from the world, self-hating and mostly apathetic- since I was about 8 years old. When I was fucking *eight*. At this point, I struggle to look back on fond memories of true, pure happiness since I've been in this state for so long. Sometimes, I become dubious of my own understanding of the concept of happiness - but the knowledge that it exists, the knowledge that I am socially alone in my illness, does nothing to help the feeling of isolation already instilled within myself. At this stage, my arms are so fucking burnt and cut that I couldn't wear a T-Shirt in public without drawing lots of unwanted attention - and having major paranoia I generally struggle to cope with any kind of public attention at all. 

Almost a year ago, I was with a girl who ended up cheating on me with another guy, not just fucking him but falling in love with him after an otherwise stable 8 month relationship. In spite of all that, I really did enjoy the time I had with her for one reason and one reason alone; Drugs. Words cannot describe how good it feels to have a substance, a switch, to just turn your brain off and send it somewhere that feels good. It felt great to finally disassociate myself from anxiety and depression, it felt great to be alive. I remember lying in my bed one night around that time whispering to myself; 'I am finally happy.'

But, naturally, once she'd cheated with me and after a painful 2 months of me trying to recollect our once beautiful relationship, I broke up with that girl and was alone again. Once I had gone through all of my own supply, I didn't have any way of getting drugs, mainly due to how paranoid I am when it comes to meeting or talking to others. So I didn't have the fucking guts to talk to a dealer, and my only gateway to happiness was gone. 

It's been a year since then. My mind is descending, slowly, into total madness. I suffer from hallucinations as a result of my minds attempt to escape from this horrible reality, I have nobody I could call a friend other than my current Girlfriend (who I keep myself tortuously alive for), and my paranoia isn't getting any better. I've been through all sorts of antidepressants and had them not work at all, I've had therapy that hasn't worked for me either. My hatred for everything around me, including myself, is at an all time high. It feels hollow to not be alive for yourself, but to force yourself to be alive for others. 

I've only really included necessary information here. I could write you a fucking book about my self pity, but I don't feel like that's necessary. I'm writing to SW because I need to stay alive for the sake of my girlfriend and my family, but living is becoming more and more of a chore. It would also be nice to feel a glimpse of happiness again. 

I'm probably going to delete this within the hour I've posted it

"Losing grip somewhat, not even sure if its a bad thingIve been battling depression on and off for years and years but recently things changed. I used to feel like the world was crashing around me and the pain i felt would be overwhelming at times. I used to think of suicide and i would cry, or id write spiteful, blaming letters in preperation. Now i dont cry, i dont feel sad or angry. I dont think its anyones fault. im not worried about my mum(she would understand more than anyone). I dont feel bad anymore. I feel like im done, and thats it. I almost miss all the sadness and anger because looking back those feelings let me know that i still cared enough to stay alive.

Im 24, not old but old enough to understand the world and what lays ahead. I feel like the best times of my life are behind me but mostly i feel like the world doesnt need another person like me. And i dont need the world. The system is fucked, i work a dead end job that a well trained dog could handle and its gonna absorb the next 40 years of my life. No freedom. I cant find freedom without money, I cant find money without feeling trapped in the circle. Eat, Sleep, Work, Repeat.

I know that plenty of people are trapped in the same system and handle it just fine, but i dont feel like that's who i am. Im happy to work hard, but i need purpose. I want freedom. I want to build my own shelter, hunt/grow my own food, take care of myself without someone telling me all these rules i have to follow. Honestly im hoping for some catastrophic event that sets the world back thousands of years. Then i could really live.

Ive survived the last 6 years on my love of direct competition. I fight, or i did. I was good too. I felt worthwhile. I believe humans were made to fight, we did it for thousands of years, and i loved the feeling of beating another man who was trying to do the same to me. I loved the feeling of taking a beating from someone better than me and knowing that next time i would be back better. Ive now got 3 bulged discs in my neck that put pressure on my spinal canal, causing constnat pain, numbness and migranes. ive got a useless knee and 2 wrecked elbows. I cant make it through a sparring session these days. Now im just another schmuck, and there's too many of us here already. Ive battled my injuries for the last 2 years(gaining a solid pain killer addiction in the process) cause the will to fight was too strong. Now its fading along with every thing else.

I raised myself since i was 12 years old, my mother had crippling depression and she didnt leave her bedroom until i was 20. Ive known hard times and ive known good times, but I dont know what these times are. Even in the hardest times, suicidal times, there was a basic instinct to survive. I feel that has passed. Im lonely, but i dont want anyone near me. I want to live, but not in this world and im happily losing the battle right now. Any advice?

Ive felt the good things of life, but right now cant see how i'll ever have them again. I wouldnt kill myself out of anger, sadness, self pitty. none of that. Simply because my time has passed. There's nothing for me to contribute to this planet anymore. I could join the system but that would be a complete and total defeat of the person i was born to be. I feel that defeat every damn day these days. The person i was born to be has had his time, and now its just a shell left in a ridiculous world.",,Depressed

"Me and my friends are working in a project to help teenagers who are socially anxious or don't have any friends, what activities should we be doing? Hi I need a little help. I recently have made new friends who are amazing and wants to help me with a project for teenagers who are socially anxious or didn't get the chance to make new friends at school because of the pandemic. 

We're planning on arranging an event in June, we're all gonna meet up by this huge and popular park in the middle of Stockholm. My plan is to make people feel welcome and not like they're gonna be judged.

"Difficult lifeHey suicidewatch, I have a story for you. 

My entire life has just been one fail after another. As of recently my brother committed suicide and this has brought to light all the feelings about death I've had my entire life. Since his death, I've moved across the USA, lost all my friends, started working at a dead end job. It has caused my girlfriend and I tons of problems. I just cannot see a way out, other than death. I have given this a lot of thought and have tried once this past week with cutting myself. I woke up in a bathtub with just red water. 

No one in my family knows about my problems dealing with this stuff other than my girlfriend. I have reached an end point. I have no idea what to do. I have no money, I have nothing anymore. My use of drugs has changed my view of the after life. I am not scared to die anymore either. Sorry that is post is all random and scattered i'm just at an end. I need help. ",,Depressed
"Need to get my thoughts down on paper, maybe i can reevaluate my life...This is going to be a detailed account of the last 1.5 years of my life. I do not expect many people to read this. It is mainly for myself.

I began smoking weed just after my 15th birthday. my cousin introduced me to it. At first i had no problem with it. I was functional, and normal in every way.

Several months later however, i began to build up a dependency on pot. I started smoking all day, every day and starting using it to escape my reality instead of enhance it. When my money wasn't enough to buy the weed i wanted, i started stealing. i Broke into my neighbors house while she was away and stole $400 from her sock drawer. I began stealing $10-50 from my mother's purse every week when i would see her. I knew she knew about it, she just didn't want to tell me she knew out of fear she wouldn't be able to spend time with me anymore (she was living alone, lonely and i only saw her once a week as it was).

I used weed to get away from all my problems. I would just get high instead of thinking about the bad things which i had done. not caring just as long as i could be high.

I began to get into some really perverted shit. Beastiality and rape fetishes, i jerked off to gory demonic sex stories, i stole my sister's panties jerked off in them, cut holes in them, and wore them. I'm not sure why this excited me. I didn't have a thing for my sister. When i look back on it whenever i'd stop to think about why i was doing whatever i was doing i would just say ""fuck it!"" and get high instead.

For months i would search any house i was left alone in, looking for shit. i searched my house, my moms, my uncle's, my neighbors, my friend's... i snuck out in the night twice to break into cars, steal quarters and other non important things. i Was a true klepto.

For me, my biggest fuck up and shame is the fact that i tried to have sex with my dog and my neighbors dog... i wont go into gory details, but it was pretty fucking disgusting.

About a year ago, i began doing shrooms 1-3 times a week on average. i continued this off and on for several months. it began to get WEIRD. i didn't trust anybody, i thought everybody was out to get me. i began to look at myself as ""that weird kid"" and i felt that everybody else saw me the same way.

The last time i did shrooms was on graduation night (i wasn't graduating, just done with sophomore year) my dad and stepmom went out to see a play, leaving me a good three hours before they'd be home. i sat on my deck, smoking weed, tripping balls on 3g of potent gumbas, taking bong rips intermittently, looking up at the trees  and smiling.

All of a sudden, i heard a voice in my mind; ""those trees are smiling back at you"" I thought... hey that was weird... i didn't think that... but didn't think twice about it. and i decided yeah... those trees were kinda smiling back on me.

Suddenly i felt like i could hear parties in all the houses around me (i live in a neighborhood with almost all old people, fairly sure there were NO parties around that night). 

I went back inside and laid down on my bed. I began to hear voices in my head... people talking at a party (i had just gotten a half ounce of mushies and had about an ounce of pot) 

""...heard he's got like an OUNCE...""   

""....his parents house he shouldn't be doing drugs there...""  

 ""....STILL say we should call the police...."" 

""....he's selling it, let's turn him in...""

These went on and on, with my frying mind freaking out not knowing what to think, i tried to tell myself i was just tripping. the voices started laughing at me. suddenly, in my mind, a woman screaming ""RAPE!!! RAPE!! PLEASE HELP ME!!! HELP ME!!!!"" and crying hysterically. I sat bolt upright, scared out of my wits.

""...this is what you like isn't it you freak...""

""...have you SEEN what kind of porn he looks at?...""

I began getting a crawling sensation all over my body and started hyperventilating, scared. the voices told me to calm down. told me they knew what was in my dresser. ""Oh shit the panties"" i thought.. over the next three hours, the voices went back over my entire life, thinking about every bad thing i've ever done. telling me how horrible of a person i was. I began to plead. please!! who are you?!

The voices told me they were kids from my school. that they were in the house next to me and had been watching me and the sick shit that i had done. they told me they had a machine that looks into and records people's minds, they could document it, and i would be put in jail on trumped up charges to be removed from the society i was a menace to. They began making me think about all the other people i knew about doing illegal things, told me because i had thought about them and it was on record, they were all going to jail too. I frantically texted me friends ""dude the police or FBI are after me you really need to get all your shit and get rid of it right now this is serious! they're coming for you next!""

They told me if i went next door and smoked them out, they would forget about the whole thing, so i left, frying my brains out, to the house next door. I searched all over the house for them. they told me their dad had seen me come in and had a bat and was coming for me. 

""GO OUT THE FRONT!!""

""NO NO HES GOING TO THE FRONT, RUN OUT THE BACK!!""

""WAIT NOW HES GOING TO THE BACK""

i didn't know what to do, i was running back and forth between exits in an empty house, listening to the voices in my head.

When my parents got home, i was sobbing on the floor thinking about all the kids i had just helped to put away for life (somehow this made sense to me). i think i convinced them i was just high and not tripping balls.i ended up going to bed that night, still scared for my sanity. 

The next day was even worse. I began fearing more and more the police were closing in on me. Around midday im in the midst of a massive panic attack brought on by the voices, i run up to my second story room, i see my winow, half double plated glass, half air conditioner. A little house in my mind tells me ""GO! jump through that window."" so i do. i fall the ten feet onto hard dirt, cutting my face fairly badly  and jarring my head ""Now DIG!"" i began tearing at the ground with my fingernails and teeth.

I then ran back inside. my sister was pulling up in a truck at this point with her boyfriend and they were wondering what the fuck was going on. i ran back in the house and began running laps around the inside of my house, i broke the railing and fell on my face again on a turn.

Finally, my parents got me to settle down and try to tell them what was happening, i told them everything, about the kids next door and their mind control device. My parents told me in no uncertain terms that such a device did NOT exist. they tried to calm me down. I wouldn't listen.

That night i slept in my sister's room with her and her boyfriend on the bed and me on the floor. i didn't want to sleep alone. I was still wrapped up in a my head and i somehow convinced myself that i had pissed people off so badly that the government who was secretly working with the mexican cartel, were sending cartel members to shoot me up with elephant tranquilizers, drag me and my family down to mexico and torture us to death.

They were very descriptive, telling me how they'd cover me in tacks or trap wasps beneath my eyelids. I got in the closet. i began thinking of the small pocket knife in my room next door and if i could get to it in time to cut my throat before the cartel members got me. luckily i didnt think i could make it. so i didnt go for it.

My sister woke up and asked me what was wrong. i told her about the cartel members and she told me to go back to bed. it'd be better in the morning.

A few minutes later my sister was asleep again and the voices were telling me how they were bringing a Rottweiler to ass fuck me since i was so into dogs. it would be bloody. and i ""better get my asshole ready"", or they'd torture my family all together. i began trying to stretch my ass, while crying. they told me to say out loud ""(sister's name) with you please fist my asshole"" and i did. I'm not sure if she was asleep or just pretended to be so she didnt have to respond. 

Following the voices instructions, i went to the bathroom, and by the fistful began to rip out my pubes and spread them over the toilet seat. it was very painful.

I went back to my room and woke my sister up, the voices had decided i had something i needed to tell her. i said ""look if you dont hit me after this, your boyfriend better."" i told her about the panties, she looked at me with a painful look in her eyes. ""They're just clothes.... it's okay... we're not gunna hurt you"" i couldn't stand it. why wasnt she just giving me what i deserved?!!?

Fast forward about a week and my parents decide this isn't stopping. they take me to a psych doctor and i try to tell them what i was experiencing. I was convinced there was mobs of people outside of the hospital trying to break in and rip me apart because of all their kids i had put in jail with my mind. I spent the night in the hospital. Without health insurance this night alone cost my parents Ten grand. When i got out i still wasnt any better. 

Over the next few months after that while the voices were still there, i began to realize things about my mind and the truth at last. I was constantly desperate for death. i got up on that balcony so many times... i still have scratch marks on my neck. at one point i was convinced my whole family was in on it too. There was one day that still... in my memory seems so much like they were trying to make me think that they wanted me to commit suicide... things like after being told there was a gun in the greenhouse being told to, pet the kitty who i NEVER petted. and was in the green house. i searched the house over for things i could use to kill myself

my sister had a talk with me. she told me in slow words, gazing deep into my eyes i could NOT kill myself, whenever she said to not do that, her eyes seemed to tell me that she was saying to do it. kill yourself you little freak. she seemed to be nodding slightly. im STILL not fully convinced this wasn't real. it seemed so real.

My next attempt i took a bunch of pills. benadryl and Klonopin. i drank a bunch of alcohol, and woke up in the ER three days later with a big tube down my throat. After struggling not to choke to death on my own spit for an hour, i shat 3 days of liquid food and the charcoal which they had used to cleanse my body into bedpans and just about died right then and there. the only worse part was getting the catheter removed.

I stayed in the hospital for 5 days. They decided to send me to a psyche ward up north for a week for suicidal and depressed teens. I wont go into detail, but it was pretty horrible.

By the time i got out of the psyche ward, i was ready for life again. i got it. i finally knew what the fuck had happened to me i had figured it all out. i was back on top again. i didn't want to kill myself anymore.

After about 2 weeks i started getting into pot again. again, it became an everyday thing and again, it became a problem. I brought pot to school, got an MIP, and found out i'd have to quit smoking pot for a month for drug testing.

The day before the drug testing started, i broke into my dad's cabinet and stole old meds. i Took 13 benadryl, 2 klonopin and 3 Lorazapam/Ativan. I smoked a shitload of weed, spent all the money i had. i knew it was ending that night.

So at about 11 i decided it was time. i got up, calmly walked outside, got onto my deck railing, and jumped. my stupid ass hit the ground feet first. i started screaming for somebody to call 911. i crawled around the house to my parents room and they called an ambulance. This was Monday the 14th (two mondays ago). i got out of the hospital the friday of that week with 2 fractures in my left foot and 1 in my spine. i have to wear a foot brace for the next month and a back brace for the next 2 1/2 months.

So here i am, thinking over this. it feels good to get it down on paper, and it took less time then i thought it would. there is a LOT that i left out and the most interesting things i convinced myself of in my head i could not tell you about because they would never make sense. But at various times i was convinced the president wanted to meet me for lunch, i was about to die, the world was about to end at my hands, that i was actually already convicted of a murder i didn't commit that had happened about a year before in my town. (oh i forgot i once just sat on a bench at a school until the police came and got me. i was dressed all in black and had a huge scar on my face from jumping through my window) I ALMOST told them i had killed the person i thought i was convicted of killing.

If any of you made it through this, please share your thoughts. I havn't done any of the perverted shit lately and i really regret so much that i've done in my past. But i've come to terms with most of it.

TL;DR:  Took mushrooms, became schizophrenic, asked sister to fist me, became suicidal, tried several times to kill myself, here i am with a broken foot and back. Thoughts?",,Depressed

"Seeking answers?Life's a bitch! That's right I'm not lying about it... I'm a low point in my life yet again. However there's been plenty of those points. So to anyone who's interested here goes a dark story.

To say it started exactly 4 years ago when I tried to take my life would be a lie... though its clear to me that that experience only broke me further.

I've moved far too many times in my past, even countries with similar cultures. Especially when I was still a child or a teen, I've been striped from roots and had to start all over again. Saying goodbye to friends and foes alike. 
During these days I had to deal with discrimination and unnecessary hate, violence and a pritty bad war of the roses. 

Choosing between parents sucks. So I tried to make it out between the country I was born in and the county that treated me like shit. Retrospectively that latter country still was the place I had the best friends... Well anyway... I stayed with my father. Big mistake! Thought he'd really go dry after he almost lost his life driving under the influence.

Back in my home country, I stayed at my grandparents place a lot, as my father worked during the day but drank in the evening in some pub. Really gotta skip I view things here but essentially, I got my life going again, viewer friends but my grades still looked well! Yay! They were so good I could even receive education. However moving up was yet again.. a mistake.

The new class didn't like my introverted personality and picked on me quickly. As I was used to getting beaten and loosing myself to anger in the past, I was trying to hold myself back. I did.
Having stress at home with a drunken dad and a horrible school day plus me missing mother, I quickly dropped grade-wise.

The thing about my grandparents. So I grew up with them a lot and they looked out after cousin now and then. A person I thought I could trust until he molested me a view times... Which obviously nobody believed. Something that contributed to my attempt 4 years ago

My first break down: it came from father, who told me ever so often how weak and quiet I have become and how he'd rather be dead than to be something like me. Yet I couldn't bring myself ever to hate him, even until this day somehow. However, it traumatised me to see him half dead on the stairs when he got home drunk a night. He told me he'd slow it down and going sober. Great! When he started the same routine 6 weeks later I couldn't take it anymore and left him, moving to my mother! Moving countries yet again. 

It'd only last a year. I was 17 and in that country already done with the obligatory amount of school years. Not quite adult tho! My father still had the custody for me and ruined my life even there. Anyway I started trying some drugs, but my sister and her bf hit it harder than me. I could retain myself. I saw the danger in it. Knowing the pain that I got rid of, was only gone temporarily. MDMA felt like heaven, not gonna lie. 

So I went back after I couldn't get a grip and got sabotaged by my own father. At least I got a decent education when I was ""home"".

(fuck my messy life is complicated to wrap up and this is getting long) 

Regardless, I had my first gf, moved in with her and we broke up after 2 years living together, because... well... I realised something was wrong with me. She was great and all, but I couldn't get intimit very often. Probably the molestations aftermath. My heart ached, yet I felt so numb. I knew people mattered to me and I could laugh, but I can not feel at the intensity I used to. Still got barley anything moving within chest to be honest

This thing that happened apparently had bigger impact on me and I needed to come clean. I spoiled it already I know. Nobody believed my molestation and my own grandmother ripped heart out. This wasn't what threw me of however. . 

THE BIG DEAL AND WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS

So you got some insight now or you skipped, both is fine but thanks for taking the time if you did in fact take your time.

Now. It was a good evening. I worked at father's place like many times. It was a kiosk with bar and after my shift I thought I could use a drink too. After serving father and his girlfriend. We played darts and everything seemed well. Until we thought we should go to their place. We played darts there too and continued drinking. Only problem is that I get really depressed when I hit a certain point. 

So I wanted to talk about some stuff he said to me in the past and defended my mother when they both tried to argue with me like so many sleepless nights... It ended with me shouting at them and crying while I walked home. That's when the voice in my head got loud and finaly convinced me to do it. For real! No pills like last time. So after crying for hours I started the process. Fuelled myself up with the spare booze so I'd feel less about the cut. Got a razor blade out and cut my right arm open, held the not so minor wound under flowing water and let it go for a while. I fainted! Not sure for how long but I had a vision... A vision I wouldn't ever be able to let go. Yet another mistake. A mistake that follows me when I try to sleep or have a rest. I won't describe it, as if you'd ever have a close call experience you'd see something different. Let me just say I was very much alone in that vision. 

When my cat meowed too loudly I could catch myself again. The adrenaline got me sober-ish again and I called the emergency. A night to forget, truly... Guess the will to live kicks in even if you think there's nothing left keeping you alive. Remember that! Surviving such an experience changes you they say. They're right! Too bad I can't help feeling I lost even more of myself and the capability to feel true emotions. 

That was 4 years ago and the story really is getting too long and mainly focuses on the bad stuff. However, nowadays I can say the last 4 years even got worse. I grew as a person perhaps yet I'm completely out of strength. The feeling that eventually my life gets better and I will be wholesomely happy persists. Can't say I'm certain I can pull through until I reach that day. 

No moral to all of this just me feeling like a husk and been drained from my energy year to year. I don't know why or how I still am, but I swore to continue for death is inevitable so why call to it. There is still so much to say... I just don't know what to say anymore.

"Thank you to this SubAbout 10 months ago I posted here that I was going to take an overdose. I did, but it didn't work and thanks to someone I got the help I needed, this started my journey into recovery. Someone from all the way over US phoned New Zealand and while I was mad at the time, with two police officers showing up at my front door, they did save my life. I would've probably escalated things like jumped off a bridge. I was extremely depressed and needed to be in hospital. I'm stable now. I just finished therapy, have a part time job, go to university and keep a good circle of friends around me. My life isn't perfect, but it's worth living.

"Throwback to that time my Alexa ordered a... ten-inch black dildo. On my parents’ account. 
TL;DR on bottom, but reading the full post is recommended to get the whole story.

Context: 

I was watching a YouTube video where a streamer has his viewers donate money to read text-to-speech messages. I happened to be watching said video right next to my Alexa, which for some reason I didn’t consider even though the title implied it. (Small brain move, I know.) 

Anyways, I was watching the video for a few minutes, and eventually that part of the video came. I didn’t think anything of it, until I heard an “Okay.” come from behind me. Words cannot explain the panic I felt as I tried to cancel it. I tried erasing everything on the Amazon shopping cart, and I thought I was in the clear. 

Days pass, nothing happens.

My dad knocks on my door and says, calmly (I know this is bad, because when he’s really upset he speaks slowly and calmly), “Come out of your room.” Heart starts beating out of my chest, I know I’m dead, etc. Well, turns out that erasing the shopping cart only showed up on their phone, and now they know I was aware it happened. 

Now normally, I would lie here, but I was backed into a corner. I explain everything, and they tell me to ‘just do the right thing’, and send me off. Extremely tame for what I thought was going to happen, but it was one hell of a ride. Thanks for reading

TL;DR A YouTube video orders a dildo on my parents’ Amazon account, I try to cancel the order, they find out anyways, then are suspiciously tame and send me on my way. (Although now probably are suspicious of me)

Basically, the moral of the story is: mute or unplug your assistant before watching a YouTube video",,Anxious

"Should I change school? (Sorry for my english)
When I was in primary school everything is great. I love that school. But then when I went to secondary school an IB school everything went down. I hate the IB system. I hate that I have to do a lot of assessments. It makes me stress every time. Ive never felt this way until I entered this school. I hate myself for choosing it. Nobody told me it was this hard. I only know it when one of my brother's friend told me about it but at that time I have chose that school and I cant change it anymore. Its been three years and two years more till I finish this torture. 

I really want to change school so bad since the first year. But this year I feel like I cant handle it anymore.

There's also another school that I wish to go but it is really far from where I lived and if I want to go there I need to stay at a hostel I think. But the second school my parents 100% will not allow me to go because that school is like where 'bad' students end up going and I really hate making them upset.

"I like to close my eyes to see what it feels likeMy thoughts are a blur so I'm using bullet points.

* Everything hurts. There is too much pain in my life. I want it to stop.

* I hate just about everything humans have done. Yeah, we've done some amazing things, but we've done a lot of extremely awful things. I don't like the societies we've created. I don't like the systems we have in place. 

* So I'm pretty depressed and suicidal. I also have zero self-worth and negative self-esteem. This has made me extremely anxious/nervous/shy. 

* I'm 20. Living at home. College dropout. No friends. Waste of space-failure at life.

* The only things in my future are college or a job. College is just like high school. Bullshit work just to make it hard. And a minimum wage job? Call me elitist but that's insulting. Those options look like they'll make me more miserable than I already am.

* I've made my plan and have started my notes.

* I don't want to 'feel better' or 'make it to tomorrow'. I want to solve my problems. 

* I've had it. I'm so sick of this. If I can't fix this, it's not worth 'enduring'. I know of something that will take care of everything.

I got it for $1000 from an auction and sold it for $4000 and bought a 1989 rx7. Then I sold that and now have a 2009 Volvo C30. My best friend is talking about getting a loan for a mustang in our group chat and I said “I wouldn’t buy something like that using anyone else’s money because then it leaves me on the line” and they didn’t like that at all. They were bringing up how it’s okay to get a loan and that they grew up in poverty and how some of us don’t have “the money to just drop a grand on a car” when my friend has about $2000 and I offered to look in the auction for her for a car. She declined and I was okay with that. It’s not my fault she has to buy a mustang $2000 more than she has. I was putting in my two cents that I wouldn’t do it and they come after me. It hurts sometimes because they act like I didn’t buy a shitbox with 100k miles as my first car with my own money. I regret selling that miata every day. I worked with my dad in his dealer every summer and every weekend washing cars and fixing them and they act like it was handed to me because it could’ve been.

"x-post from r/depression - thinking of reporting childhood sexual abuseBasically when I was 8 my older brother molested me a few times a week for a few months. Also throughout my childhood he used to beat the shit out of me and make death threats. When he moved out, he changed. Now we're ""good friends"" and I forgive him.
But growing up my mom was also physically/emotionally abusive and I got the brunt of it, being the scapegoat of the family. I just feel like he and my mom got away with forever shattering my self-esteem and treating me less than human for years. I feel betrayed, hurt, worthless, sick, disgusted with myself. I have intrusive thoughts about this shit on a near daily basis and I'm 19 now.
On one hand, I feel like a terrible person for even thinking about reporting my brother since he's changed. But on the other hand part of me cannot be sure that he has not done this to other people because if someone is capable of doing this to their own little sister, who else could they have done this to? Plus a very selfish part of me wants someone to take personal responsibility, because all my fucking life people that were supposed to love me unconditionally and protect me, that I was supposed to be able to trust, have hurt me in ways that make me feel sick to my stomach. I just feel so broken, I just want to move on. Like, people in my family KNOW that the abuse happened but did nothing to stop it and were never there for me. My dad was angry at me and MOCKED me when i told him i didn't feel comfortable having my brother over to our house when the whole sexual abuse thing came up. He told me that I need to move on. I WANT to move on but it's. always. there. It won't go away, I have anxiety attacks when people physically get too close to me and I cry when I try to have sex. Seemingly mundane things that remind me of certain situations with my mom or my brother make me feel...weird. Like I space out and kind of get lost in my head and think about specific memories and feel a million miles away while also being hyperaware of my surroundings. I won't feel real. I feel numb and disconnected. I have nightmares sometimes.
I feel like it's bullshit that I have to deal with this yet they get to sleep comfortably at night. I want them to deal with what they've done. Yet I feel like a vindictive piece of shit for feeling this way and that it's hard because I've rationalized their behavior so much and feel empathy for them and do forgive them, but I have all this rage and anguish and no way to release it and it's just bottling up and I'm going to explode, there's no one left to hate but myself.",,Depressed

"The CORRECT way to propose The social media and films nowadays are saturated with people proposing to their SO in a public place(most likely a restaurant) and getting down on one knee in front of an audience taking out the ring. The thing is every single one of us is well aware of this method and thinks its ""romantic"" and the perfect way to do it, While its not. It causes alot of issues for the person proposing where they have to put themselves in the spotlight and do something bold, publicly which isnt something most people are comfortable with making them fall down the rabbit hole of procrastination and hesitation. For the person being proposed to, it puts them into a massive dilemma where even if they dont want to get married they are afraid of rejecting the person publicly and causing a lot of repercussion for both of them in the relationship.  
So in some situations, the person accepts the ring, making the person proposing very hopeful but later rejects, the idea of marriage which shatters them OR in most situations they just reject them publicly causing their relationship to end then and there.  
Ever since i met my SO ive talked about this with them casually  
And expressed the fact that i was against such an act and if it ever came to it  
i would propose somewhere private  
or if we are somewhere public I just give her the ring casually and tell her that she can take as much time as she wants to think about it.  
and my S/O was extremely in favour of the idea saying that's how it should be  
and that's how it should be for everyone

"How do you know it's not a crush? This has been typed out after months and months of thinking (or overthinking if that's more accurate).

First, here's a few things about me. I'm a single extrovert (ENFP in particular if you're one of the people who wonder about those) who's never been in a relationship with anyone and yet I know my way around when it comes to dealing with people of all sorts. I have this habit where I keep analysing every single detail, gestures made by people, the way they talk, etc. I used not to be like this but because of traumatizing experience and multiple melancholic ordeals I've been through in my life, I came into a certain agreement with myself that something had to change. I became a better version of myself despite never going through any therapy sessions *(or at least that's what I'd like to believe—you'll find out why those brackets are here in a bit)*.

I used to be sensitive as fuck, but, like I said, something had to change. I stopped crying over every little thing I used to cry over like a baby. I mastered that to the point where people who have known me for a while now have never seen my crying/angry/nervous face.

Nowadays, when a person fucks with me, it doesn't really get to me or affect my life/day in any way and I'd just be like, ""dude's got a problem. Whatever.""

It's basically that I became familiar with all the horrendous shit people put you through sometimes (or all the time). I take my hat off for you if you're still reading up until this point. You're probably wondering how any of the above has anything to do with the title of this post. Patience, homie. We're almost there. I did say before that I'm the type of person who does some deep, deep analysis of things—what did you expect?

Anyways, back to the point. I talked about the crap you get from people sometimes and how it doesn't affect me, right? Well, last year, I got to know a terrible person who was irresponsible, entitled, rude, senseless, impatient, annoying, etc. And I didn't really mind because...who gives a fuck about him? He's not worth the attention. So, I never gave it to him. I actually didn't really need that person to get to where I needed so I managed on my own, worked all alone and I made it to the top  without him. He left the place we see him at and we never heard of him again.

End of the story? I don't think so. Flashforward to this year where I met a person who does the same job as the mean one who left. The only difference is that he was much more patient, sincerely passionate about his duties, high-key charismatic, sweeter than honey, and even a devil would proudly become an angel when they see how much of a hard worker he is. Because of him, I have turned from a lazy cow to a workaholic. And when I say I'm workaholic, I don't mean the negative definition that leads you into thinking that my life got ruined because of it. No, it didn't. Do you know why? It's because I, somehow, managed to turn into who I am *willingly.* This person is a real life magician. Everyone loves him very much and it's as if he's a celebrity. I'm saying that because lots and lots of people keep surrounding him, talking to him, taking pics of him and even hanging out with him.

It's been a while since I've got to know this person, but it's only been recently when we actually saw each other's faces in real life since most of what we did all along was online through Zoom. All the ""celebrity vibes"" behaviors where after we met him.

And now...we get to the most important part of this post. My feelings. You are definitely guessing that I'll be asking whether I have a crush on him or love him, right? Man, I won't go ahead and say you're wrong, but remember the part where I said I used to be very sensitive? When I said I stopped being a crybaby? The surprise is that I went back to being that. I suddenly became the extremely sensitive person I once was. When I didn't get enough attention from that person, tears would always find their way out of my eyes. They never came out when I was with the rude person. It was at this moment when I realized that not having therapy was a bit of a problem. At least that was what I thought at first since I never really got offended by anyone else when they didn't give me the attention I needed. It was just HIM who made me cry when he's been nothing but a wonderful person. The question I was asking myself was why I got angry every time he talked and laughed with a girl while I was just standing there, looking at them. I don't hate anyone but I'd hate that girl at this moment. 

I know I'm stating the obvious. I just thought something was wrong. I became very sensitive because of that person's presence in my life. I cry every day when I feel like I don't exist in his world or when he forgets about me or doesn't see my messages on Zoom or WhatsApp. I broke my rules about not having any social media accounts and I installed Instagram especially for him when I knew that he replied to DMs faster there. When I tapped the ""follow"" button on his profile, I took it back again and the next thing I knew was that I was feeling ""empowered"" just because he followed me and I didn't follow him back. This was seriously absurd. It still is because I was acting weird. I mean, what the actual fuck? What was I doing exactly?

I met him today and ended up crying in my mom's car again. I wasn't ready to cry but, when Mom asked me about what's wrong and why I seemed so upset, the tears just rolled down my cheeks again. I didn't get it. I didn't understand why I was crying just because I didn't get to walk out of the building with him like that other girl who kept walking with him and talking casually because they knew each other from before. I didn't know why I was being like this because...usually, like I stated earlier, I'd just think of it as a silly little shitty thing and then carry on with my life. But this? There was nothing shitty about it to begin with and I was acting like there was while I didn't understand the reasons behind my actions.

And that's when I got astonished by Mom's straightforwardness. She said, ""dear, I know we all get to have a crush on a person from time to time, and that's okay but...you can't fall for a person you know he wouldn't love you back. It will just hurt you.""

Yes. That cliche conversation with your Mom in soap operas. Me denying that it was ""nothing like that"" and saying that she was delusional and that it was the other girls who had a crush on him but not me. Her saying that she saw all the signs and that it wasn't just a crush.

And now there's also me at 2:00 AM, rethinking everything all over again and typing this since 7:00 PM but falling asleep with red, puffy eyes while doing it.

I started acting weird ever since I knew this person. I was behaving in a way I never thought I would. I've never had a crush on a person nor did I fall for anyone before. I'm still single and I have no experience with any relationships or even feelings like the ones I'm having at the moment. I was doubting that I had depression or something because I even lost weight and there were days where I was insomniac. I knew from the start that people won't always notice your existence and I was okay with that and I actually adapted to things being this way. But all of this was ruined after knowing that person.

So, I'm asking again...

How do you know it's not a crush? I thought that the problem was with me at first but then what Mom said today hit me so hard that it was all I was thinking about throughout the day. I looked back at how I acted since the day I knew him and, magically, everything was revolving around him in one way or another. If I'm eating noodles, I'd be like, ""does person X like noodles?"" If I'm working out, I'd think, ""how does person X work out to get those muscles?"" When I go to the cafe he usually goes to, I'd imagine myself meeting him coincidentally, which, amazingly, just happened two days ago. And I took advantage of my extroverted side to actually go to him and talk about...anything really. I somehow managed to improvise something on the spot. Talked hilariously and made him laugh...which I kinda felt proud of for some reason. But here's another thing I realized. This person was the only one I trembled while talking to, and he was the hardest to make eye contact with. I'm saying this, not as an anxious person who struggles with people, but as one who knows nothing but how to deal with people and is forced to deal with them in a daily basis. I didn't understand why I'd tremble or get that tickling feeling in my stomach...the one you get when you're about to come up the stage and perform something in front of so many people. It was weird because I didn't have a problem with being on stage and talking in public. I was capable of doing that. What I was not capable of, however, is acting normally around that person. I'd feel stupid when I stand in front of him and suddenly run out of things to say. He stairs at me, eyes full of questions, and I'd just say I was done with what I wanted to tell him.

I know you might be laughing at the screen of your phone while reading this, but listen here. You're laughing because you've probably been through this before, if not more. But here? Me? No. No, no, no. I have never been through this, and because I never was, I'm sorting out everything here to see what people who know about those things would say.

And now...

If it's a crush, how long will it take for those feelings to fade away?

If it's not a crush, what am I supposed to do about it?

"Slim jim kid. I forgot his name so im going to call him SJ (for slim jim. I’ll get to that story soon)

In middle school my 3rd period was PE and pretty quickly SJ became my friend.

Him, me, and some girl were talking all period every day so we had some funny adventures together.

First I’ll talk about the slim jim story.
SJ always looked under and behind the bleachers for bo reason and the coach never paid attention so one day SJ found an old, hard, and gross slim jim. SJ asked me if i wanted him to shank steven (the kid everyone hates, especially me) i told him it was a stupid idea so he asked the girl who hung out with us, she told him (while holding back a laugh) not to do it. He did it. SJ shanked a kid with a meat stick.

Before all that was another less funny event, he forgot his ADHD meds. He managed to break his glasses, attack me, our other friend, and steven all in like 3 days. For 3 days i was pushing a kid half my size away from a girl who was a foot taller than him so he didnt hurt her (or himself), which got him mad at me, so i had to avoid his head first charging for 45 minutes a day. I got yelled at for pushing him. Then SJ got sent to the nurse for charging at students head first.

I told SJ that i was bi but he thought that it meant i had slept with both a guy and a girl, so i had to explain to him that being attracted to someone is different from having sex with them illegally. The conversation went to other LGBTQ stuff so for some reason he thought he was a trans girl. He definitely wasn’t.

"I’m not sure if I’m the only one dealing with this My maternal grandparents have been living with my family for close to a year now. I liked it for a little bit until I realized that they would be staying with us for a long time (maybe even the rest of their lives). My house has 3 bedrooms. Here’s what has happened:
1. My mom and sister sleep in the master bedroom.
2. My dad sleeps in the study on an ottoman which folds out into a bed. (Normally he would also sleep in the master bedroom but he’s a doctor and is worried he may end up giving COVID-19 to everyone after he comes home from work.)
3. My grandma sleeps in my room.
4. My grandpa sleeps in my sister’s room. (My sister doesn’t sleep in her room, she just keeps her stuff there and sleeps in the master bedroom.)
This more or less leaves me without a room to myself. This forces me to sleep in the family room or the formal living room (the place that guests sit when they come over). This leaves me without a place to work or keep my stuff (my grandma basically took over my entire room and she uses my desk all the time). My mom and dad are also getting a new house built and it’s about halfway there, but the construction is going very slow (It’s not because of the coronavirus, it’s actually because the carpenter is making wooden fixtures for other houses while he is at our new house’s construction site). Each time I tell my mom that I don’t have my own place to work in my current house, she tells me that I just need to wait a few more weeks. But she’s been saying this for over three months and there haven’t been any significant advancements in construction at our new house (which will have enough bedrooms for me to have my own while my grandparents stay with us) since April. I’m honestly not sure what to do and it’s very irritating that I can’t have my own room. Does anyone know how I can deal with this situation?",,Anxious

"Study shows that too much hw is harmful. Spread the word. A Stanford researcher found that students in high-achieving communities who spend too much time on homework experience more stress, physical health problems, a lack of balance and even alienation from society. More than two hours of homework a night may be counterproductive, according to the study.


Pope and her colleagues found that too much homework can diminish its effectiveness and even be counterproductive. They cite prior research indicating that homework benefits plateau at about two hours per night, and that 90 minutes to two and a half hours is optimal for high school.


Their study found that too much homework is associated with:


• Greater stress: 56 percent of the students considered homework a primary source of stress, according to the survey data. Forty-three percent viewed tests as a primary stressor, while 33 percent put the pressure to get good grades in that category. Less than 1 percent of the students said homework was not a stressor.


• Reductions in health: In their open-ended answers, many students said their homework load led to sleep deprivation and other health problems. The researchers asked students whether they experienced health issues such as headaches, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, weight loss and stomach problems.


• Less time for friends, family and extracurricular pursuits: Both the survey data and student responses indicate that spending too much time on homework meant that students were “not meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills,” according to the researchers. Students were more likely to drop activities, not see friends or family, and not pursue hobbies they enjoy.




The results offer empirical evidence that many students struggle to find balance between homework, extracurricular activities and social time, the researchers said. Many students felt forced or obligated to choose homework over developing other talents or skills.


Also, there was no relationship between the time spent on homework and how much the student enjoyed it. The research quoted students as saying they often do homework they see as “pointless” or “mindless” in order to keep their grades up.


“This kind of busy work, by its very nature, discourages learning and instead promotes doing homework simply to get points,” Pope said.



She said the research calls into question the value of assigning large amounts of homework in high-performing schools. Homework should not be simply assigned as a routine practice, she said.


“Rather, any homework assigned should have a purpose and benefit, and it should be designed to cultivate learning and development,” wrote Pope.



TL;DR : study shows that over 2 hours of hw can negatively effect student. Hw should only be assigned to benefit the students and  should not be assigned as a regular practice. Too much hw can lead students to become sleep deprived, isolated, and stressed.",,Stressed

"Literally nothing to live for?I don't really know why I'm writing this, but I don't have anyone to vent to and if I feel like if I don't write this out I'll start to feel even worse..
So, to start things off, I've been planning to kill myself for years now, but I always found myself saying and being told ""it'll get better."" fast forward a few years later, absolutely nothing has gotten better, I've hit rock bottom. My parents got divorced and i blame myself for it- they ended up divorcing because of a fight they had because I forgot one of my keys to the house at home while they were at work, so they argued over who would come and get me or let me in. Due to this, there's always fighting in both of their houses, mostly over the divorce and over financial problems. Without their income combined, there's barely enough money to pay rent for either of them. Not to mention that with my dad's leave, my mother has been letting an abuser and a pedophile stay with us. To be honest, I shouldn't really say that she lets him, rather than he refuses to leave. He doesn't have a job, and although there's nothing wrong with that in itself, he constantly belittles my mom for working at a low-paying one, and makes fun of us for being on food stamps. I've watched him beat her and choke my sister before. He's molested me, he's picked the locks on my bedroom door before, he's picked the lock to the bathroom when I'm in the shower. He constantly breaks things, there are countless doors off of their hinges and holes in the walls. The police know of this, and they say that because he technically ""lives"" with us (has stayed there for an extended period of time) we can't make him move without an official eviction, which we can't afford. He constantly calls is both bitches, says women shouln't talk, and says he wishes he could kill us. I love my mom to death and it hurts so much to see her with him. 
I'm made fun of all of the time at school. Recently, I had to transfer and am stuck with no friends. Please don't say ""just go out there and make some!"" I've tried. I've tried clubs, sports, basically everything I could think of. I try to talk to people, but they just look at me like I'm gross and don't respond. The only time people talk to me is to ask me out as a joke, to call me ugly, or to call me fat. I know I'm pathetic. 
I've had friends in the past. I even have a girlfriend. But lately, I found out she doesn't like me anymore. I can accept that, but I feel kind of betrayed, because she's the only one i know in real life who I've told about my depression, and she ignored me for a few hours before telling her friend(who ended up telling me in the end) that I was passive aggressive, frustrating, and oversensitive. I found out that she also has feelings for said friend.
This has happened to me before, too. My past girlfriend cheated on me with at least four people, and when I was upset about it and told people, most of them didn't believe me or didn't care. I lost almost all of my friends over this. 
I also feel like I'll never be able to be myself around anyone because I'm a lesbian. I know my family wouldn't accept me. If I made new friends, they wouldn't accept me.
I have no job. No friends. Absolutely no talent or hobbies. My brain is a mess. My mental illnesses are getting the best of me. I'm always alone. I don't know what to do.
I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
If anyone's been through/is in a similar situation, do you have any advice? I know this sounds desperate and probably over dramatic, and I'm sorry. I just feel really alone right now. I can't stop thinking about ending everything. ",,Depressed

"Low point in lifeSo today (Halloween) is my birthday, birthday number 32.

One year ago, I had had a rough year already but I had no idea it was about to get so much worse.

On December 11th last year, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. It's not bad — yet — but it does not bode well for the future. While there are a number of new medicines, there is no cure.

I had been engaged since May of 2013, and she had stuck with me during some really shitty times. We began planning our wedding in February of this year, and it was set for September 19th. My bipolar disorder was too much for her to handle, and she finally left in June.

Now today, my birthday, I've found myself finding out that the person I've seen for 3 months, a person I could really imagine a future with, is kind of in love with someone else.

On Monday of this week, I was hospitalized against my will for a major psychotic episode.

Needless to say, things are not looking up. It was hard to imagine my 31st year being worse than age 30, but somehow it was. Things were really looking up in 2013 — after years of really deep depression, I had found myself in a really good relationship for two years, proposed, and it felt like life was getting started finally. It's hard to imagine how 32 will be any worse than 31.

On this past Monday, I came to with a bunch of cops and firemen around me. My ex-fiancée and a friend had called in a safety check on me because I had been non-responsive. The funny thing was there was a bright red noose hanging in my apartment, but somehow nobody said anything about it, not a single cop or anyone. It was the most obvious thing in the world. I was still forced to go to the hospital, though, because I had taken too many sleeping pills.

So…I kind of feel an inevitability to suicide now. I have for a long time, but it's crossed a line into being more inevitable, if that's a thing. This rope I have is something I bought back in March, back when the wedding was still a foregone conclusion. This is a person I had been really shitty to in a wide variety of ways, but of course I miss them more than anything in the world now. Among many reasons, they got tired of me always being suicidal.

I had a great life ahead of me — after I proposed, we moved to New York and the Netherlands together, and I was working on master's degree. I dropped out of that program and spent the next 6 months in a depressed state, barely able to function, keeping her isolated in a foreign country. Then we moved back to the U.S. and she had a lot more to put up with over the next year. You can't blame her for walking out. I was always suicidal, always have been, and to a large degree I've gotten myself to this point because I wanted to have a reason to push myself over the edge. Well: good job, me. I've done that.

Any other bipolar people reading this? And any others that feel they've ruined their life on purpose in order to get themselves closer to suicide?

hi. im 13. ever since i was like 11 ive had a bad week every couple of months where i’ve thought of suicide and such. since about january though, it’s become every single night i’ve thought and done some suicidal stuff. i haven’t ended up in hospital, and nobody has ever noticed this. for the past 2 months it’s just been 24/7 suicidal thoughts. 
the issue here is, i don’t really have the other symptoms of depression (weight loss/gain, not leaving the house, etc) i don’t do the stuff i like to as much though, but it’s not noticeable. i don’t have a good relationship with my parents where i could tell them this stuff. they give me the responsibilities of my parents, but the freedom of a 4 year old.

I think of how that could've been good, but could also be bad. And my body keeps punishing me for the potentially bad thing. I see the worst outcomes of past scenarios, and my body hurts me. That time in elementary school where I made fun of that kid? There's another scar. Then there are times that I think of stuff like ""What if I could've tried to help someone, but only made myself look dumb because I can't do anything right?"" My bruise gets bigger. That last one isn't even based off of any thing and I still can't stop thinking about it. I think if I had to sum up my existence in one word it would be ""upsetting"". Everything makes me upset. I just recently saw a ladybug who looked crippled, it looked sad and its wing looked broken. I felt bad for it because it was in pain, but at the same time I'm terrified of bugs, so I couldn't do anything other than stare at it in agony. That was upsetting. I think of the time someone did something that was unintentional but still ended up being bad, and how they must feel after doing that thing unintentionally. So it ends up with me getting a shit end of the stick because someone else screwed up, and I still manage to feel sorry for them. Fucking hell. I can't function right.

"loneliness is such a drag..hello, I am struggling a lot right now, especially lately.  My life has fallen apart and Ive just been surviving from hour to hour for almost 2 years it feels like, and no matter how many different methods or times I try to get help, nothing ever fucking helps.  It all started when I broke my back april 2014, I already had a bad back since I was 15 or 16 which caused me to miss sleep, chronic nerve pain and other issues, for which all they ever did was give me giant tylenols, send me for 2 massages and that was it.  It never helped one bit.  Fast forward years later my back has quit bugging me for awhile, I am going to the gym about 5-6 days a week and I am sober at this time, I feel pretty good but still depressed sometimes which is why I spend all my time working out.  On my birthday two years ago I broke my back even worse and since then my life has been a disaster.   I spent the entire week after just eating pill after pill of hydromorphone but it never even got rid of the pain and bc of how much it hurt, I slouched and slouched and i Just sat in this awful position and healed like that for a week, and my body has never ever ever been the same.  I can no longer digest food, my back has hurt every single fucking day ever since.  On top of all this ive already suffered anxiety/depresssion ever since I was a child bc I was molested multiple times.  Oh yeah, did I mention I broke my back on my birthday, ABOUT 10 DAYS B4 I MOVED INTO MY HOUSE.  I had bought a house with my dad and worked on it for months and months and when the time finally comes to move in, I break my back.  Now I can't ever work bc my back hurts all the goddamn time and if i try to even work I just ended up puking or crying so I get fired by text from some job after my grandpa passes away and I ask for a week off, and just cant motivate my self to try to work anymore.  The worst part is, is nothing has gotten better almost after all this time.  I lost my fucking house, I am only 22 years old.  My body hurts everyday, I always think it would be so much easier to just kill myself than try to fix this fucked up mess.  I don't have friends anymore I have moved away 3500km away from all my family and friends I knew, simply because I couldnt pay for anything anymore I lost my house, I tried going to the doctor for help with mental illness and my back, and nothing is covered by insurances except for pills pills pills.  I tried SSRIS for a month and had horrrrrrible results, wanted to kill myself, almost constantly, I couldn't sleep beyond an hour a night and when I did sleep, I would wake up covered in sweat everytime and have to go shower.  I got rejected from financial assistance bc of this house that is technically mine on paper that I no longer have, it is just being rented by my dad to cover the mortgage costs right now.  Every day I wake up and want to die, and force myself to try to be as positive as I can, and try to clean up my apartment everyday and feed myself but lately I feel like even that is way too much of a task for myself.  I tried to go to my doc for my back and he was reluctant to believe that I was suffering, then he finally took x-rays and saw that I had ""narrowing in the lower spine"" multiple herniated discs and also ""loss of the natural curve"".  What does he do to try to help?? he gives me naproxen and cyclobenzaprine.  The naproxen pills really just fucked my body/stomach up even worse and apparently might have given me ulcers.  Now fast forward again from this time and I am moved across the country away from everything after I lost my house, and I have now lost about 30lbs, I can't digest anything anymore it seems like, I also show signs of internal bleeding and am awaiting more tests for that.  I am still not working, still in extreme debt and the only thing, the only small relief I ever get, is smoking weed.  And even though it is technically ""legalized"" for medical use, no fucking doctor anywhere will even consider it.  Even with a broken back, inability to digest food, and depression, these useless cunts can't do anything to relieve suffering.  ""Marijuana is just a depressant, it will just make you more depressed"".  You don't understand the fucking anger in me,  because of a bunch of people's ignorance I can't even get access to the only medicine that helps me and instead I get to deal with drug dealers and losing the last few cents I had in my life.  God knows I would go out and get a job and work if I could and god knows I tried too, but I dont have a fucking clue how to fix anything in my life and everytime I try to I just end up in more pain.  I really wish god would take me, I'm so done with this place.  I don't understand what in the actual fuck my purpose for existing here is right now, WHAT COULD BE SO WORTH IT THAT I NEED TO SUFFER THIS MUCH FUCKING PAIN ALL THE TIME?? I cant even fucking sleep anymore I slept 2 hours tonight then woke up at 2am bc of my fucking spine and have been awake since.  I hate my life.  I hate our fucking society, I hate everything.  My grandmother who I lived with part-time passed away when I was 12, and every single day I think about her and try to use it as strength to go on but lately all I can think of is how I want to join her.",,Depressed

"How do I find someone from school online? **TL;DR:** I’ve noticed that I’ve had this boy on my mind quite a lot lately. I’ve never met him but I’ve only seen/heard positive things about him. This is rare because there are few people at my school who I can even tolerate. I’d really like to get to know him, but, because I’m doing online school, I don’t know how to find him. I’d like to get to know him sooner than later. I know what he looks like but don’t know his name. How could I find him to talk to him (preferably online)?
_____________________________________________________________________________________

There’s a couple people from school who I’ll see in the hallways or who I’ll have classes who I’d really like to get to know. The things is, I have social anxiety and struggle to approach people in real life. Through texting wouldn’t be as hard. There’s one person in particular who comes to mind. Recently, I’ve noticed that I’ve been thinking about him more than I do, well, anyone else from school except for my friends.  

I haven’t said a word to him. He probably doesn’t even know I exist. The closest I’ve ever gotten to him is sitting at the same table at lunch on the first day of school. I didn’t pay too much attention to him then, but now (or at least when I was still in school... thanks coronavirus) he catches my eye in the hallways. I know he’s friends or at least was friends with a close friend of mines sister. I’ve never had a class with him. I think he’s a year above me (I’m going to be a sophomore— he’ll be a junior). I’d like to talk to him but I don’t know how. I was thinking about asking this close friend but it may sound weird. 

I have the feeling that I really, really want to be friends with him or get to know him, but I don’t know if it’s more than that. I’ve never had a crush before and I don’t know if I’m starting to crush or not. I’ve actually worried about it (never having a crush) a lot during these past couple months (thanks quarantine mental health). I think I’m demisexual (must get to know someone and develop a connection with them before feeling romantic/sexual attraction towards them), but it’s probably too early to tell. Anyways, my heart doesn’t flutter or anything, but I feel a comfort wash over me and I start to daydream a bit. It’s hard to see myself dating anyone right now, but I can see myself with him more than I can everyone else. 

I mean, I’ve thought about a future partner and he seems to have a lot of the same qualities. We have (some of) the same views (I know he’s a part of the LGBTQ+ and straight alliance club (which, once again, is rare around here)— no he’s not gay), he’s intelligent, he’s a sweetheart, he’s funny, we have similar music taste, he seems to respect women as human beings and not objects (which is rare for my school), and more. He’s pretty cute too. Honestly he’s shares a lot of the same qualities physically with my future “dream partners”, too. The thing is, one of his most attractive qualities will be my downfall. He adores and respects his girlfriend so, so much. He talks about her all the time (I could tell when we sat at lunch together) and in a very respectful way. Normally I’m annoyed by this but it was so genuine that I couldn’t even get mad. I mean, his girlfriend is pretty cool too. I’d like to get to know her too as we seem pretty similar but, if I’d have to get to know one, I’d like to know him.

I think I’d be okay with just staying friends because he just seems like a fun guy to be around and someone I’d like in my life. Anyways, sorry, I know you didn’t ask for my life story, but maybe someone’s dealing with something similar...?",,Anxious

"My parents think I have mental problems. Because I talked in an open group chat. That's it, that's the post.

\[Edit: Please don't criticize me about Kpop. This could literally have happened with any other artist or topic and it would have ended the exact same way. I am not here to ask about your opinions on music, but for advice on the more serious issue.\]

Here's some context: I like Kpop, and I don't have many real life friends who do. My parents also happen to be big antis. They don't allow me to listen to Kpop, look at the idols, and all that whatnot. The reason being they're ""fake"" and will lead me into bad habits. But I've been pretty undercover about it, and I don't do that much anyway-- I just listen to the music. I think they've gotten somewhat used to it now, though. My parents are also very strict and guarded. I'm not allowed to go on social media much, I can't attend social events unless they're academic, I have never facetimed a friend, and I don't think I've gone out with anyone except my parents since last year. (I'm an only child.)

Last night at around 1am, I was tired, but my mind was awake. I had downloaded Kakaotalk a couple weeks ago. For those of you who don't know, it's a Korean messaging app. One feature was still new to me, the open chat, and I wanted to try it out. How it works is you can search for a topic, and join group chats with people who like the same topic. My favorite Kpop group Stray Kids had just come back recently with a new album, so I thought it would be interesting to talk with some other people about it. So I searched up Stray Kids, and joined in a room with a couple hundred people. I don't really know how the culture is like in these chats, but being a new person I introduced myself (said my name, but that's it) and said my bias in the group. Then some people welcomed me so I chatted with them for a bit. It was only a few texts, about nothing in particular. Then I got sleepy so I said I have to go. And fell asleep.  
Today I was attending a class via Zoom and heard my parents discussing downstairs. They said ""she needs a therapist"" and I was curious who they were talking about, so I asked. It was me.My mom came running into my room and throwing insults at me. Said I need a therapist and I was being controlled by Satan (mind you, we are a Christian family). She proceeds to say that if I can't sleep at night, I should do my homework. And both of them yell at me for the remainder of my class. The bad thing is, we're required to turn our videos on for Zoom. So I had to slouch in my chair the whole time and only show my forehead because I was crying.There's actually some more but I would have to give too much context, and I'm not really in the mood to write a whole novel right now.

But I really need to know. Is this really a valid reason to say I'm mentally damaged and need help? Because I am 99.99% certain I am not. I've made online friends before, on Discord. I am completely familiar with the Discord Kpop community, and reveal a limited part of my identity. I know the risks, and I know how to take care of myself. Plus, Kakaotalk has complete anonymity in the open group chats, so they can't see anything except my name and picture (which was a pic of me without my face. nothing revealing).

I don't know what I'm asking for writing this post, probably just validation, but I want to know that I'm not the only one who thinks I didn't do anything wrong. Yes, it was against my parents' standards, but do I really have to go see a therapist now???

"I want to get helpI’ve had depression and anxiety for a while now, even though I’m so young. I was supposed to see a doctor this year for that, but now I can’t see one until November. I haven’t seen a doctor in 3 years since my parents divorced.

My therapist can’t be there as often as I need.
I feel like I can’t talk to any of my friends or family because they brush me off.

So I started writing a note, started making a plan and everything.

I want to get help so, so bad. I want to be understood.
I start school tomorrow. Maybe if I tell the counselor she will care? But then I’d probably be sent off somewhere. 

Would that be a good thing? Would I need to be sent off like that? Maybe it’s the only way I’ll get taken seriously. Maybe I just need to indulge in my self-harm habits again so I can get help. 

I just want the pain to stop..",,Depressed

"Time is almost up.I was framed for Rape and Torture. Google “Timothy Hebberley” if you don’t believe me. You’ll be scrolling for a long time before I proved I was innocent. Funny, that. This woman targeted me while I was in an emotionally weak state, having already blocked her on all social media as well as changing my cellphone number specifically to get away from her. I’d recently been dumped close to Valentine’s Day, 2013. She somehow found out, and got ahold of me somehow. This woman showed me a stock photo of a pregnant woman, told me she was pregnant with my child from the one time we fucked; Which by the way, I should mention that she raped me while I was dating the girl who dumped me for a Valentine’s Day present. She was an ex, and convinced me to hang out to maintain a friendship due to a mutual interest over Halo. She started stripping. Me, being faithful to my girlfriend, decided to tell her she was fucked in the head and tried to leave. She said that if I left without fucking her, she’d tell the police I raped her. I cried the whole time, especially after ejaculating. I felt disgusting. I’d cheated. I was raped, yeah. But I’d cheated. So I punished myself with more cutting than usual. I hated myself. I got dumped. She found me again. She showed me that photo. We started dating. I was used like a toy, not just for sex, but all other manner of foul shit. I’ll describe it later as I see fit, if it’s deemed necessary for you to get the point. I spent two and a half years with this... Thing. I got away. She decided to threaten my family with arson and murder if I ever told anyone the things she did. I told the cops what I had to, to protect my Family. Or so I believed, at the time. I decided that after everything else; Being cut, stabbed with needles, urinated on, screamed at, beaten... After all of that, bringing my Family into it was what made me stand up to her. I went to the Police. 3 months later I was being arrested for 43 charges. For not feeling remorse for my crime; I was sentenced to 11 years in jail. After 926 days, I was released due to actually being innocent. The Crown decided to say that I’d completed “Time Served” for my malicious crimes, while dropping most of them. I feel that it’s important to mention that before the jury was allowed to deliberate, my charges went from 43 to 26 due to Perjury. Despite her General Practitioner, a medical professional, coming to the Stand, Under Oath. Telling them that my charge of dislocating her hip was physically impossible. Still found guilty. I was sentenced to 11 years in jail. I shook my head in Court when the sentence was passed. When she (7/10 jury members were female, along with the detective in charge of my case, along with the Crown Prosecutor, along with the Judge? What chance did I have as long as I had a penis...) told me I felt no remorse; I laughed. How can I feel remorse for something that never happened? More time passes in jail. In New Zealand, we have ACC to cover accidents. Rape victims are paid $10,000 NZD. Even after my Rape charges were dropped, and her Perjury MORE than proven, she never had to pay it back. Because she has a vagina. Pussy pass is real. She never got a criminal charge, either. Providing False Testimony, as well as Perjury x 15+, and got away with it because she had a Vagina. Don’t even fucking at me. Don’t you fucking dare. I was raped, tortured, and HAD TO SIT THERE IN COURT, LISTENING TO HER TELL A JURY THAT I DID TO HER WHAT SHE PERFORMED ON ME. I nearly chewed through my finger to keep myself quiet. 


After all of this, and trying to adjust; I decided to let a Woman back into my life. She took Private and Personal information about me; and gave it to people who hate me for HER lies, to use as ammunition against me, as soon as I let her past my personal boundaries.

The word of a Woman is with less than the mud you scrape from your boot. They are never worth listening to. Women are poison, and they deserve to die as the Toxic Slugs they are. My opinion on this doesn’t really matter, though. I have a penis, and my word is therefore worth nothing. 





In 2 months, I’m consuming three and a half months of sleeping medication along with a bottle of Vodka. I’ll slit my wrists just to make sure. I hate Humans as a whole. I hope you all rot, fade, and die. Fuck you all. I can’t study what I want. I can’t leave the Country, MY HOME, because of this. I’m trapped in perpetual pain. I’m forced to live because you won’t accept responsibility for your mistakes. I want you to know that from the bottom of my heart, I hate you all. All of you here have options, a future you CAN build. Mine was taken from me. I hate you all. Rot. Burn. Be wiped away like the scum you all really are. 

You want to know what I REALLY wish for ALL of you? I hope you’re Flayed alive. Then rolled in Salt. Then set Alight. Just before you die from the pain, I want you drowned. Each, and EVERY one of you. Just for being Human. The same way I wasn’t believed just for being a Heterosexual Caucasian Male. Fuck all of you.",,Depressed

"First relationship ended I'm 15 and I'm an introvert who's moved 3 times and can't talk to people at all. Corona happened and I was stuck at home doing nothing. I started playing Minecraft on a server playing bedwars. Met this person who I played with for 2 weeks when I leave to go eat, I come back to find they found more people to play with and wanted me to meet them. The people were 2 girls, (one was 18 and one was 16). I met them both and we got to know each other. I joined a discord server who my ex owned (16 year old) and got into a voice chat. We agreed to pull and all nighter because we could and we wanted to. And in that night people on her server joined the voice chat and they started to talk about birthdays. Then she says ""if anyone can guess my birthday, I'll share a lewd photo of me"" That was supposed to be a red flag but my hormones got the best of me and didn't realize it. I found out that she lives in Chicago and I live in Cali.



Fast forward some time and I start to mention how beautiful she looks and we start to flirt and tells me how nice it would be to meet and kiss, cuddle and cute stuff like that. I really liked her at this point and I didn't want to mention her as a friend so I didn't mess anything up with her in the process. 


Some days later we're all playing like normal and then she just leaves out of the blue. I didn't think much and the 18 year old says not to worry she's just upset. Later on instagram she sends me ""I'm not coming back, It's just not working out"" I'm confused and hurt that she left. She unfriends me on discord too. I reply with that I'm confused on why she left and if she leaves that's on her, can't stop her, I let her know she's hurting more than she knows.

"Hi, suicidal thoughts/addiction helpI dont know what to do anymore. I have a good job and am 29 but no matter how much money I make I blow it. I’m sliding into debt basically because of my addiction. It isnt a normal addiction so I dont know who cares, I will go out once a month maybe, maybe more than that and have a few drinks and even though I know I shouldnt do it I’ll end up in a whore house, high, by the end they will give credit and I wake up and I am fucked again. 

Im typically a very anxious/worry prone person and this behaviour makes everything 100x worse....I am constantly worrying, I cant see a way out for my idiotic behaviour, I never thought of suicide before but now I am increasingly, I dont want to be a burden to my parents anymore and I dont want to worry anymore.


To those who say dont do what your doing...yes, i can go for weeks without drinking and then self destruct and blow all the work in a day, I fucking hate myself, my lack of willpower. 

I dont know what to do at this point so maybe this is just venting. I never took drugs until I started working 7/8years back either. 

I dont blame anyone else for this although as said before 7yrs ago I had never ever had any inclination to pay for sex nor had I taken drugs, I guess the late 30s/40s senior people I worked with were all into tha big time and thats what started it. But now I have developed a full blown issue.

So, thats it. I am on the train now, I know myself and I know that its a matter of time before I work up the courage. I’ve pretty much thought of this non stol for months..

One is my French online pen-pal, we're both working on improving. And we have been! We/I haven't talked to as long ly as the others.

One is....I don't know anymore. Not sure if he wants to talk with me anymore (though maybe it's cause I'm feeling down. Or maybe he is busy, or maybe he really doesn't want to talk anymore...

"I’m crying I appreciate anybody who reads to the end of this.

Whenever I’m alone and I have no distractions I always end up getting really sad and crying. Thinking about my past just messes me up. I’ll be talking about the difficulties in my life below, and just knowing that one person listens to this makes me feel better as if I’m not alone, even if it’s strangers on reddit.

Starting with my earliest memories of elementary school, I remember not being included with all the other kids and always being an outcast. I’m assuming it was either because of how annoying I was, my passion for bugs, or how unkept I looked. Well, moving forward, I didn’t have any friends in kindergarten.

In first grade I made one friend, her name was Kayla. I was fitting in with the other kids more. Although my dad and mom were constantly fighting which made me, in a way, separate myself from the other kids. Eventually they lived in different houses and me and my siblings took turns living with each of them for a week.

Experiencing this made me more weird as a kid, and I started fitting in even less. I became attention-seeking from the lack of attention my parents gave me but I tried earning it in a bad way by annoying everybody. Eventually I got on everybody’s bad side and nobody liked me, except my one friend Kayla.

Second grade my parents were having a lot of problems with each other and my siblings were being affected by it too. In turn, they became aggressive and fought and fought. I was bullied constantly by my two older siblings. Eventually I grew used to being by myself since I’m always isolated. I didn’t pay too much attention to it.

Third grade was the last time I ever spoke to my dad before he disappeared to a different country. The last thing I remember saying to him was “When are you gonna come back?” And he said “Never.” And I started crying so my mom took the phone away from me and I couldn’t communicate with him ever again.

Fourth grade I’m always alone. My only friend doesn’t hang out with me as much. I was isolating myself completely from everybody else. My mom was depressed and always working because my dad took away all of our money and left us in debt. I didn’t ever see my mom and the only love I got was from my aunts which I rarely ever see.

Fifth grade I was bullied by another girl. She told other people bad things about me and would hit me. I kept crying to my mom about it and my teacher but it didn’t stop. Eventually my mom near the end of the grade finally talked to my bullies mom and she never talked to me again.

Sixth grade I wanted to change my life and get more friends. And it worked, I got friends. Although my mom is still broken from the divorce, and my siblings still bully me and laugh at me when I’m hurt.

Seventh grade I had severe anxiety and depression problems. I was mean to my friends sometimes too, which I really regret. I didn’t really talk to anybody except my small circle of friends. My mom finally recovered from the debt we had.

Eighth grade I realized my dad started a new family. I looked up his Facebook account and saw videos of him teaching a little girl how to ride her bike. I also saw my mother cry in front of me for the first time during a therapy session.

Ninth grade my two closest friends lost someone who was even closer to them than me to suicide. I partially blame myself for his suicide, I don’t want to go into detail.

Tenth grade and I’m depressed as fuck, I’m not the greatest person and life hurts.

Love anyone who bothered to read all this",,Depressed

"Ok which one of you is cumming in his sister's shampoo again? Check out this story, copypasted from relationship_advice

So this is a bit of a long story, but a couple months ago, I (18F) noticed a couple streaks of white in the purple shampoo i was using, I didn’t think much of it at the time but I didn’t use it as I thought maybe my brother (16M) was using that bottle for something else, it was almost empty anyways.

I got more shampoo, this time it was a white coconut shampoo, and was using it in my hair regularly until i noticed it had moved from the shelf in the shower to a different spot. It was about 3/4ths gone by then, and I’d bought 2 bottles so I began using a different bottle and keeping that in my bathroom drawer so no one touched it.

As time went on, the shampoo bottle in the shower literally was slowly filling up almost halfway full, when i decided to mark it and watch how it filled. Within a week or so it was filled past the mark. I checked, it definitely wasn’t water, and it fucking stank. I think he’s been shaking the bottle up too, to mix it together. Nobody touches the soaps in our shared bathroom but me and him, and he has his own shampoo so there’s no reason for him to touch mine. My only logical conclusion is that he’s been masturbating into my coconut shampoo.

Quite honestly this disgusts me and freaks me out and I don’t know at all how to tell my parents or how to talk to him about it. I’ve developed a fear of using the soaps in our bathroom and I’ve been showering at my boyfriend’s house every day. The shampoo bottle is still there it’s almost full by now, does he think this is some sort of game? I’d like to understand why this is happening but I don’t want to look like a fool if I don’t have any proof.

Sorry this is such a weird and gross situation but I really need help here. Any advice on how to work through this?

"How should i feel about this?/ vent Hi everyone.

I hope this isnt bad for this subreddit , but i figured since im a teenager and im a bit anxious about this , it could be here.

Im 17, i went to my friends house (he is 18) with our friend that is a girl (she is 17 too i think).

We went drinking , had a strong Slovakian alcohol , it was a 62 percent one. We had a couple of shots and the girl started to get closer to both of us than usual. She has a boyfriend btw. My 18 yo buddy wasnt as drunk as me as the girl were , so he kept a cool head during most of the time we were at his house. Since she was getting closer and touching things she normaly wouldnt, i kissed her. She asked what i did , i just said i dont know , we both just smiled and continued. She was going after my friend too , she said that it was bcs she didnt want him to feel alone, bcs we were obiously going after each other. She said she wants a threesome , she wanted my friend to go to the toilet with her and undress her etc etc. When she was with me , we started kissing and it slowly turned to her being almost half naked and my finger in her.

After that me and my friend decided we should go home. Me and the girl went back to the city , and before we went on the bus , we kissed more and she said that she really wants to fuck me and that i cant even imagine how she wants me. I told her if she says the same while completely sober , we can talk about it. This went on in the bus station , she rolled her eyes ahegao style everytime i touched her thighs. Once we were sober , her mother called so she was a bit off the mood. We talked about whats gonna go down with us from now on , i asked her if she wants to be my girlfriend , she said yes, we had a couple more kisses , then i accompanied her to where her father was waiting. We hugged she told me she will msg me and i went home. I lent her my hoodie , she was really amazed how it smelled and i kinda forgot she had it. When i got home , i msg her and she was cofused as to how and what happened. So i told her to let me know how she feels and i wont be mad even if she says that she doesnt want to be with me. She said she is confused as to what she wants etc. She said that she meant all the things she said etc.

I couldnt sleep the whole night, idk why , and we didnt talk today at all. She msged me in the evening to talk about the day we drank and she said that , she is sorry and she really really likes me and doesnt want to lose me and that she hopes that this wont affect our friendship in some way and that i she is not into me as i may think and she doesnt think that im into her and that the alcohol played a part. She asked if we are okay or can ever be okay with each other.

I told her im not mad and that i share the same opinion, that alcohol played a big part.

Its a long one sorry , skipped some parts , but i wanted to vent it out and what you ppl think about this story.",,Anxious

My entire life I've been in low level classes. I've always done mediocre in those classes. So on Monday, I had a Really really hard US Government test. Ok, so I study my ass off during the day on Monday. It is my last class and I had a free period(substitute teacher) , study hall, and then lunch, then this class. I studied the ENTIRE time, went STRAIGHT to the library and didn't look up from my book once, re read the chapter, made friends with a smart kid in my class whk lend me some note cards to study from. Ok I got this, I go into take the test and I fucking bomb it. I got a 46%. On Tuesday I had a physics quiz. Ok, I my parents who am so thankful for hire me one of the best physics tutors in thr city. I study, I understand the material (or so I thaught). I got a fucking FOUR out of 20. The lowest grade in the class. Granted most people got 10/20's I still felt like I have down syndrome. This blonde bimbo in the class who says the most retarded shit gets the highest grade being an 85. Tuesday I also had a math test. Again, I have a tutor for this, one I've been seeing for months. A close friend of my teacher. I actually study a lot and think I know the material. Leaving the test my body physically felt numb.all that fucking studying and I still fucking didn't know how to do some of the problems. I don't know what I got on this one yet but I feel like if I fucking think about grades of college one more fucking time I think I'm going to explode. I have such a shitty GPA I am dreaming of getting into a shitty state school. Meanwhile my friends make Jokes about the idiots who go to the schools I want to go to. Every time we have a college meeting we get a pice if paper with our GPA on if and shit and every single time every kid is showing thier grades and shit meanwhile I'm pretending not to exist.

"Just added another mental disorder to the list... So I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my freshman year of high school. Last year, I got minor OCD and minor ADHD added to the list. NOW I just discovered another disorder that I have.

It's called Maladaptive Daydreaming. In the most basic terms, my brain figured out how to make really vivid and intense inner worlds and kind of zone out to escape to these places as a coping mechanism. I talk to myself a lot. I make music playlists that fit certain themes to trigger certain daydreams to start playing. I daydream for hours every day. It's basically like a movie constantly playing in my head and it distracts me from real life, homework, and just things going on around me. All day. Every day.

Didn't even know this was a mental disorder. I knew it wasn't completely normal, but I thought that most people probably did this to some degree. I was wrong.

"tips for you guys and gals from a long time user of this subreddit dear teenagers of reddit, Im a long time user of this sub, probably since october 2017 and I have seen everything on new. Recently I turned 18 years of age and let me tell you, please, for the love of God, enjoy these amazing years because you will eventually grow up and have a shit ton to do, more responsibilities, college... I spent my teen years never going to parties or hanging on with my buddies, I wasted them and I urge you not to do what I did. If you get socially anxious, I get it, it was my case, but do not chicken out like I did always and try, get out of your comfort zone. There is no need to be obsessed with romantic love, eventually you will find someone, you will have to put yourselves out there. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT date someone you fell in love via online, it will never work, the chances are very slim, I personally know what it is like to be in a Long Distance Relationship and I kind of wasted my time for 5 months with this girl, have though about her everyday since the day we met and that was on the 15th September 2018. Search for girls in your area, not online like I did. Avoid using social media like instagram, only use it to communicate with you buddies, specially girls, social media is cancer and someday you will understand what I mean. Do not spend a lot of time here, I did and regret it, avoid using your phone too much. Study hard, thats the only way you will get a life in the future. Stay safe from covid, have protected sex if you end up doing it lol, spend time with your friends, leave girls or boys for university, you won't regret it.",,Anxious

"Cant cope with LifeI've been abusing alcohol for a while now. Now im just depressed. My aunt died in a car accident a month ago and it triggered my depression very bad. I'm pretty sure i have a small degree of bipolar disorder for some days I feel like I can do anything and everything. But as of right now I want to die.

My family is kinda broke and my dad would close a big money deal, so if that works out Ill have to pull myself out of this dark place, at least ill be a worthless heir, I have that to look forward to. If it doesnt happen my dad could die, hes old mid 70s old, and this is his life work we are talking about, I pulled some weight on that deal, I think that is also triggering my anxiety. The uncertainty.

Im about to withdraw from the last class befoe getting my degree I just cant write an academic paper, ive failed 3 times already, maybe four times if i dont retire, and then i'd be expelled.  I had a semi-manic episode and wrote something very exciting, turns out its pseudo-scientific. Instead of working on that paper i waste my life on the internet and on TV i just cant deal with life. I wanted to be a lawyer so bad but now I just forgot why I started.  I've been putting my bjj belt around my neck, im really scared i might do it one day. I cant talk to my dad hes very old school and would be so disapoined, my mom does her best, but I resent her, shes a bit narcisistic and her attitudes helped me get to this place.  I mean she told me ""your dad is a bum he dreams of his big money deal and does nothing"" it scarred me. Also my dad was like the most interesting man in the world. My life is being depressed and getting drunk and making a fool of myself. My family is status obsessed, I drank that kool aid and now i realize im just a normal fellow. But man this depression is killing me.

I'm going to see a therapist today for alcohol abuse. Hopefully I'll get better and if all works out I'll give a shot to being happy. I kind of wanted to vent.

"Just some thoughts Just some of my stressful thoughts. 

I'm stressed about my school. I probably have it easier then most because I don't need to go to classes, so maybe I shouldn't be stressed but I am. It could be that I'm lazy, or it could be that I'm just super uninterested in algebra. I like one of my courses but hate the math and am even cheating at it and I get stressed because I'll be disappointing my parents and I'm not learning anything but I just don't have the motivation. 


If I tell my parents that I don't want to do math they'll probably just brush it off and make me keep doing it because I've done it all my life and everyone in my family thinks I love math but I hate it. Ideally I'd want to become a astronaut, but that's the unreachable dream that I'm pretty sure would be completely impossible even if I tried because I'm diabetic and I wouldn't be able to take my life saving medicine. Other then that I'm interested in possibly being a therapist and maybe maybe maybe a architect but I'd need to do lots of math which I'd be unhappy with. 

I probably shouldn't be stressing about this now as I'm only 15 but damn I can't help it. I just don't know where I'm going. And I don't want to disappoint my parents

Another thing I'm stressed about is my sexuality. I'm confused currently but I'm pretty sure I'm bisexual, idk though. And coming out would be stressful asf. I've already told my sister who is supportive of the LGBT+ community but I tried saying it out loud but I physically couldn't so I did it over text.  She's supportive so that's good though. 

And I'm living with ten other people with three of them being 5 or younger and since I'm the second oldest I need to constantly watch over them. And my sister has a cat which I generally don't like and am allergic to so I'm constantly sneezing and sniffling and have watery eyes. 

My mom doesn't even work and has a apartment that she's at half the time because living with everyone is to stressful. I try to understand but it's hard. She has depression and I try to help but it's hard. I'm trying my best but it's hard.

"For all of you who are wanting to talk to a girl/guy you like, or just get know more people but you think you are too introverted I want to give some advice. I myself am an extrovert sometimes and an introvert sometimes, it depends on the people I am around, so I understand what it is like to be introverted. I am going to talk to a girl I don’t have any classes with tomorrow, which is very nerve racking on the introverted side of me and makes me get some extreme anxiety because I find attraction in this girl as well. To give an example of what to do when talking to new people you need to...

1: Push yourself beyond your limits that you think you have. This can really go for anything, but in this case you need to open up and start talking to people instead of worrying what they think about you. You should have nothing to worry about because if they judge you by your looks before or after you talk to them they are bad people, and you dodges a bullet. 

2: Engage in conversation with the person you want to talk to. To start off you can go two ways you can either start talking to them in a group of people if you have mutual friends in there of course, or you need to find a time that they are alone and you can get like a one minute conversation out of them at minimum. 

2a: If you go for the method of them being alone this is my preferred choice because I think it is easier to start a conversation with them. The great thing about this option is that you get to choose when you want to talk to them it can be walking down the hallway, in the lunch line, outside, in a class if you have free time, or whenever you feel like it. To start the conversation with them you need to walk up to them and introduce yourself and ask their name, but if you already know it you can compliment them in a low key way. For example you could say: Hey so and so, I like your shoes. They would then probably say something along the lines of thank you and after that you can start talking to them.

2b: This method is trickier because you once again have to kinda get them alone/isolated from the group a little bit. You can start be getting closer and closer to them then greeting, complimenting, or asking them a question about themselves. They will then reflect this question back at you and boom! You have engaged in conversation with that person this also goes for 2a.

2c: This one is a bit odd in my opinion, but if you can get a friend to give you their number you can start talking with them over text and then transition into real life. All the things you can do in real life/ 2a and 2b can be applied to text.

3: Once you have started talking to this person you can then go talk to them the next day or whenever you feel like it. From there you can learn more about them and get their phone number so you  can start talking more.

4: If you are looking for a relationship with this person than you need to start flirting with them either in person or over text and see how they respond to it. Do this for sometime before you finally ask  the person out.

I hoped this helped some people out there who are looking to meet someone new. If you think you are too introverted for this you will not get very far in life, but you can also push yourself to the limits and try to make it farther. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",,Anxious

"Answering the age old question of why dudes get praised for having high body counts while women get slut shamed It’s a simple answer, for decently attractive women it takes absolutely no effort to get a man, there are so many dudes throwing themselves a lot of the time, especially really pretty girls. it would take no effort to sleep with one of the guys she knows if you are a somewhat attractive girl. 

Men get praised because getting a girl as a man is pretty damn hard, going up to girls and having the confidence to talk to a stranger is pretty impressive when you consider the fact the most girls would be too shy or nervous to go up to a guy, it takes genuine effort and confidence for guys because they are usually the one chasing, it takes actual skill since they usually carry the conversation, etc

Think about it like this, I used to work as a waiter for my first job and we relied on tips, imagine the number of tips representing a body count, there was girl, extremely shy she wouldn’t say anything to the people to make the service better, but she was attractive, people tipped her ALOT of money solely because of her looks and her nice body, me, on the other hand, I was trying me best to never mix up the orders, had engaging conversations, and recommended them foods and drinks they ended up enjoying, I barely got any tips compared to her, even when I did it took way more effort since I had to understand the customers and the type of food they liked a recommended them things.No matter how attractive I am a girl isn’t gonna tip me that much money compared to what the guys are tipping her 

Now imagine I was bragging to my friends about the extra money, they would congratulate me right, of course .since It took the effort to earn those tips, but why would the girls brag about her tips, she isn’t gonna get praised for all those tips because they came easy",,Anxious

"16 years old, suicidal.I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to put here but, in a nut shell. I've had the feeling of depression and suicidal thoughts for about the past 9 or 10 years. It started when I was either 6 or 7 and my great grandfather passed away. I didn't really know him well, but of course my family did. He passed away 3 days before my birthday. Ever since then, no one has cared about my birthday, they would always be sad and wouldn't even remember my birthday. So at first I felt really worthless and uncared for.

Fast forward to last year, my suicidal thoughts got so much worse. School was stressing me the fuck out, and my life at home wasn't the best either. I would go to school to a bunch of people who are a bunch of dickheads for no reason, and teachers who would assign hours of homework, mainly essays and projects. With not enough time am too much to do, I would do bad on them and be pissed off and disappointed with myself for not doing well. And my older brother was amazing when it came to school. So whenever I'd compare my failures to all of his successes I would always get so angry and sad. 

Then I'd come home to my parents that would constantly be arguing. Then their anger would be transferred to me and I'd get into trouble for no fucking reason. I would get yelled at and beaten for no reason. I have a girlfriend, she sometimes makes it better. But most of the time I still feel worthless and can't seem to fix it. October of last year I got the courage to tell my parents that I had suicidal thoughts and thought I was depressed. They set up an appointment and sure enough I was diagnosed with severe major depression disorder. I was prescribed Lexapro or escitalopram. My parents started treating me differently. I felt like a freak. I tried taking it easy and taking the meds while trying to remain calm at all times. I couldn't hang with it. About a month or two ago I stopped taking the meds even though I wasn't supposed to. I haven't been improving. My anger is back and getting worse, my sadness is back and getting worse. I've read comments about people saying to do something that you like to keep you calm or distracted. For me it was playing video games, almost like entering a new world completely. I would play video games and I'd be very competitive about them. Lately I've been rage quitting so often and they piss me off that I would look for ways to hurt myself or try to hit things without causing much damage to my house. Point being my hobby isn't helping me anymore. 

My girlfriend is moving away in a couple months to go off to college. No one will care about me then. I'm also the middle child. My older brother goes through everything first and my younger brother is the baby of the family. I fucking hate my life. I am not sure when but I am planning on killing myself on my birthday. This way my fucking family will have a reason to remember my birthday, whether they like it or not. My birthday is July 26th. I was thinking of next year after I graduate from high school, I would kill myself on my birthday. I'm not sure as to how yet, but I've thought that either hanging or taking a knife and cutting up my arms or slitting my throat. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

"Push &amp; Press (77) 4 Days Left of 2020. Wow. What a year it has been, a **rollercoaster.** **YOU** made it through, We made it through. **Together, Separately.** I am feeling tired, exhausted and I know you might be too, but THIS is not the time to stop or settle down, we **NEED** to keep pushing and pressing. With what we are focusing on, letting go, embracing, **KEEP PUSHING.**

Grey days. During Canada's winters it can be tough; spiritually, mentally &amp; physically. Seasonal Affective Disorder is prominent in all of us. If you are reading this from somewhere else in the world and you are asking me, Drey what is Seasonal Affective Disorder? Well Seasonal Affective Disorder affects us with the lack of sunshine and warmth we get it during the Winter Days usually from November all the way until March sometimes, wow.........I just realized how much of a battle it really is. **WE PRESS ON.** As I want you to **PUSH &amp; PRESS,** if you are from Canada or if you aren't, we are all exhausted and tired from this year. I believe in you to finish this year, in the strongest way **OF YOUR LIFE.**

It takes time. Its day to day. We should realize that every single person on the journey, will never had it all figured out, will never say ""I'm healed"", its not possible. There are many things we can heal from but that only allows us to then take on the next level and layer needed to heal. We are all **one**, we are all **different**. We are all **connected**, we are all **unique**. We are all **passionate**, we all have **different passions**. We all act in **kindness**, we all show **love**, **empathy** and **compassion** to **ourselves** and others in different ways.

This is what makes me feel so grateful to be a human and to have interactions and experiences with people from many different walks of life. To experience, listen and gain a perspective that I would not have learned. We must listen to one another. We must be **present.** Present with ourselves and the ones that we are allowed to surround ourselves with in this very moment. Things change quickly, friendships come and go, relationships come and go, the only one that will **ALWAYS** stay is **YOU. BE**there for others but remember that **YOU** have to **BE** there for **YOURSELF** first.

How are you suppose to grab the marbles in the jar for yourself if they have been all used up for everyone else? We only have a certain limit everyday. Use them wisely but be kind and empathetic. Release Ego.

I love you.

"I lost my last chance in loveI lost my last chance in love.

I am 30 years old. And 5""3' guy. It took 6 years to find her. When I started dating her, I didn't think she is the one. Because I was focused on finding someone who is attractive. She wasn't attractive to me at all but not repulsive either. What made me interested at first and this was the reason I've agreed to meet her at the first place is that she was extremely tall (like 6 foot) and I am short. During the relationship I found out she had a great personality (minus some medium size issues I thought I could live with if she were pretty), and I knew that, and yet, I thought I would only love her if she would be attractive, at least a bit! So I made her do things to improve it. That backfired as she didn't want to alter her physique for me and wanted to stay the way she is and to be accepted and loved the way she is. As I remained focused on that and bitter that she didn't want to make adjustments in my direction, we ended the relationship because of continous fights over this matter.

8 months have passed and I have found a new girl which is very attractive,  but short and with average personality. I felt like I was not having fun like with the first. There was much less sexual compatability, she wasn't talkative and she was boring. I felt like I really missed it. Later I also suddenly discovered the thought that the tall girl would average out the height of my children. This thought just popped into my head in an instant. I didn't want to have children in life because I thought they would be short and I feel that this had screwed me up in life. So I also thought like I would have children with my SO happily and without regrets. I didn't have this thought while in the relationship with her. Its a new thought that just appeared recently. Thinking back, her height also made me feel better about mine.
I felt so bad when I just thought about it that I prepared a love letter to her, and after 8 months of silence wanted to get her back and contacted her. 


SHE DID NOT WANT TO GO BACK AND JUST STARTED A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

I feel so devastated. I barely slept this week, I dont eat much, I feel so terrible. I feel that I've made the biggest mistake in my life. I'm wondering if ending it is a good idea. I will not get another chance with a new girl because there won't be anyone this tall with a great personality. It's really a zero chance. This thing is so rare. I dated for so long time so I know how rare that is. I screwed it up big time. I'm fucked. I was so stupid so ignore all of this when I focused only on her looks. I am also not so young anymore.. I'm 30. Soon all the girls would be married with children. I doubt I will ever have a chance to love again and be satisfied with a new woman without comparing it to this lost one. I will always regret this mistake till the day I die and won't ever be satisfied with a new girl. I don't know how to rationalize this to escape from this hole. It seems so hopeless now. Then what's the point of continuing on?

I have no intentions as of now of killing myself this moment. But I am thinking maybe long term I will. I'm mainly using the reddit to find inspiration for my situation.

TL;DR: 30 years old guy dumped a wonderful girl with zero chance of finding a similar one, regretted it, contacted her and she doesn't want to go back. Feeling like I've lost my only chance in life.",,Depressed

"I'm tiredI'm not sure if I want to die, but I know I want to just stop. Take a minute, step out of my life, and stop to put my head down. I want to get out of myself and rest but I can't really do that, can I? I need to work enough to cover medical bills. I need to stay here for my husband. I need to clean. I need to pay bills. I need to keep going. 

Except I just don't want to anymore. I don't want to be in my city, except I have no choice but to be here. I don't want to be in my country, except I can't leave as we don't have the money or resources to be here. Likewise my husband doesn't want to leave his family.  I want to have a child, but I could never afford to give birth let alone take care of one. 

I just feel like little by little I'm burying everything I want under obligations, expenses and... just an understanding that *I can't do any of it.* It's no one's fault. It's just how it is. It happens to everyone. I'm not trying hard enough. I'm not doing enough.  I'm not enough and it's no one's fault really; It just happens that's how it is. I can't envision the future. I can't imagine myself in a year, let alone five. I'm just trying to get through each day and week to get to the next. 

I realize I'll have these breakdowns where I become aware of everything. I will become aware of what I want and don't/can't achieve, and I'll become sad. I'll get anxious. I'll get upset. Then I'll forget all about it and move on for another few months.

Ok we get this that it's harder sometimes when you are black, overweighted.. Or anything. But the solution isn't to vent about how injust it is because ""those people have more advantages that's so unfair"" it just looks like a witch hunt to find who has the most privileges to make their lives harder or something or just to expose them. People doing this are just pointing out at the other people and it looks like discrimination. This is also totally unlegitimate because just like you, those people did not choose to be white or pretty. Pointing them out and making their situation seen as a bad thing is just a good process to get enemy with them whereas they asked for nothing. This is also immature to point out people like this and to always try to see where the grass is greener instead of actually prioritizing doing more effort. Also this vision of ""privileged"" people is just looking like a big cliche about white people and it feels very arbitrary. Basically, people who are always bragging about pribileges are also the worst because they are the one who always divide people in cases and apply a tag to them whereas it is exactly what they are claiming to fight against.

"I'm killing myself on sunday morningI was happy with the girl of my dreams, then it turns out I guess I was fed lies. I never did anything to hurt her and now I don't have anyone. I did what she asked of me and turns to her parents and they make her break up with me. Then she tells me that's not what she wants and she wants to stay with me. I needed her, I did my best to care for her. She asked me to stand up for her I did, I take the blame and I take the shit for stuff she did. She goes to her parents, but this time they say it is enough (I only did as she said).

So they start trying to file a claim of harassment (I WAS DOING AS SHE TOLD ME) and then making her cut all contact. They then must have gotten things to spread and now at school I'm getting labeled as abusive, shitty, an asshole, a rapist, a sex offender. I can't take this shit anymore.

I did my best to be nice but I got used. I've had some decent friends and now they all used me and here's another one. I hate being treated this way and I'm so alone.

Today I was getting glares from all of her friends while I was crying in the back of the class. I had to lie to my counselor that I would be okay and I would be there on monday. I won't be.

Like I'm so fed up with getting used and lied to. I know she knows she hurt me, and she won't stand up for me or tell her parents what really happened.

To make things even better today my school's campus police officer told me that I was the reason she would no longer be getting a professional education, and that I ruined her life. I should be gone. Everyone is trying to ruin me and spread rumors and bully me and I have no friends and I've been used. 

To make things best they can be, she told me she would fight for me and stand up for me and that I would be okay and she loved me and she would be lost without me and I tried my best to be there for her. Then she chewed me up and spat me out.

"*Trigger warning - suicide, bad mental health* I got a job and recovered from bad mental health after years of suffering with depression anxiety and crippling emetophobia For years (as long as I can remember) I’ve struggled with my mental health. I’ve been taken advantage of and I’ve been through tough arguments with “friends” and I’ve gone through struggle after struggle after struggle. I’m now pleased to report that at 15 years old I’m on the path to recovery and I’ve got a job helping out with office work my nan does (although it may have been a pity job bc my Nan saw how much I was stressing about finance and stuff) and I earn minimum wage which is good in context. Over lockdown I developed unhealthy and crippling emetophobia that stopped me from visiting my dad (moms divorced twice) and I’m finally starting to show signs of progress and going to my dads more. I’m finally working more and doing more revision for my gcses which is good seeing as I didn’t do anything before. I used to have daily panic attacks that lasted anywhere from 7 seconds to 7 hours, but usually lasted 2 hours. I used to have daily suicidal thoughts and I considered taking my own life seriously several times a day. I had the image so clearly in my mind. But then 2 things happened - I told my mom and her bf (who lives with us - they were both understanding and opened up to me more) about my mental health and how I need help. I also stopped hanging out with my old friends who were causing me to be stressed and anxious because I tried to fit in which lead to me forcing myself into that position.

"Something as simple as pumpkin pie I've been getting along real well with my dad. I'm 18 years of age and he's been gone for 6 of them. He's been back in my life and this year has been rough. But ever since Thanks giving day when my mom was freaking out on him (like the absolute Karen she is), I defended him. We have been getting along genuinely well.

Today at around 8 PM, I went into the kitchen. He was about to go out into the back to smoke. I was looking in the kitchen for something and he said theres pumpkin pie, and I took it out to have some. He said that he hasnt had any yet and I told him there's an extra pie in the fridge. I told him that I've never had apple pie before. He noted that and told me that his mom used t make the best apple pie ever. Then we started talking about his mom. How she ran the kitchen but my grandpa did all the main cooking. Then he started talking about how his dad was a damn good dad but strict. My dad learned how to cook because my grandpa instructed him sternly ""do this like i did. No you are doing it wrong!"""". I was genuinely invested in this story. So was he! He never talked about his family before. I never knew his side. He had four brothers! I didn't fucking know that. And a sister named Angela. I didn't know that! We got to really talking about his family. His dad and his uncle were mean sons of bitches who yelled a lot and taught by example. They always yelled, but never laid a hand on my dad. 

My dad was talking about how when he fucked up his dad gave him a mean ass stare that said ""I'm disappointed in you."" Without saying a single word. That right there made my dad wish my grandpa hit him. Anything is better than the stare. He told me about how he was the second oldest of the five children. I didn't know that! Thats so cool! He told me about how the two youngest boys used to fight all the time. Physical fist fights. The funniest part was about how he and the oldest brother used to just watch those two just go at it. At a certain point they just pulled them away and told them okay fuckers calm down, idiots. He told me that if the oldest didn't stop them, they might have actually tried killing each other. That story was so funny to me and him.

After that my dad told me about how he and his brothers hated the youngest for being the mommas baby. She always protected him as moms do. They always loved him though. Never laid a hand on him. He said to me that the only time he hit one of his brothers was when he was 11, and the oldest brother took something from him. He told him give me back my shit, then he didn't. My dad sucker punched his brother, and said give it back. He did. No fear or anger from either side. That's just mutual understanding. Man boomer life was tough, you punch your brother hard then five minutes later start joking around.

My dad was really loving telling this story. He put down his jacket and just stood there talking to me about these stories. This was the first EVER time my dad told me about his childhood in such depth. I absolutely adored this. For one half hour we stood in the middle of the kitchen of a dilapidating trailer, having a wonderful time talking about his childhood. We connected for the first time in god knows how long, if it had ever happened before. My dad is a genuinely great man. I would have loved to have known him and his brothers while they were growing up. I want to meet my uncles. One died. The second youngest one. I met him a few times and actually liked him. I hope he's resting well in heaven. To think that all of this happened because my dad pointed out apple pie. We grew closer because of an unhealthy sugar filled round pumpkin desert.

"No! Punishing a person equally who falsely accused another of rape is not a good idea. Hear me out first  

This will probably get buried in New but I wanted to say this because I've been seeing these posts frequently about how accuser should be punished the same or even worse than a person who has committed a crime if it is a false accusation. Punishing them as equally bad misses the point. Rape is a crime that is notoriously difficult to prove. And if someone is not proven guilty then they are pronounced to be innocent(innocent until proven guilty). Regard this case : A man rapes a woman in her sleep, she wakes up to find out that she is being raped. She can't speak because she is in shock(which is wayy fequent than I'd like for it to be). If she goes to the police, she doesn't have any evidence to prove it, so the rapist is free. Would it be justified to punish her?

Not only that but the victims of abuse and assault, whether they be man or woman, always feels like they are at fault whereas the perpetrator usually believe that they are right in doing so.

What I think should be done instead is that they should apologise and then the media should clarify that the accused was innocent. It's not a full proof plan so I would like to have a civil and logical discussion about it. And please don't bring your feelings into this. I'd love to have better ideas about this problem here.",,Normal

"Where do I go?I could use some advice, and reddit has always been good to me.

I've struggled with depression since my early teens. I've managed to keep it almost in check, but the only thing that's kept me going is my wife.

This burden eventually became to much for her, and she left me about 2 months ago. That was a major trigger for me - I lost my job, my three year old daughter was hospitalized after slipping on some ice, and my wife left the day after valentine's day... It was too much for me to handle.

Since that day I've been completely paralyzed - I don't even want to get out of my bed. I've had a couple of job interviews, but I have no confidence in myself, and the potential employers have clearly sensed this and I have not had any offers.

At this point the only person left in my life who's opinion matters to me is my wife (not divorced, just separated - though I doubt that will last for long.

At this point, I'm ready to give up. My wife has no feelings left for me other than resentment, my daughter can sense my issues and doesn't want to be with me, and I have no friends left.

I'm ready to do the unthinkable, but I would rather find help. I'm scared of myself. Do I go to the hospital? What's the best option?",,Depressed

No more anything....it brings a smile to my face just thinking about it. That's the only thing that makes me smile. A shotgun in my mouth. I'm never going to know love. I'm never going to know peace. I'm never going to know tranquility. All I know is hate and disgust and conflict. Before you tell me to go to a therapist, I did. She told me I have post traumatic stress disorder. I stopped going after that. I'm not strong enough to face that demon. I'm surprised I made it this far but it's only a matter of time now. Soon I will sleep. I will know peace.

"I need some advice on flirting with a girl. So obviously there is a girl I like. And we are pretty friendly, enough that I have her number in my phone and we talk from time to time. 

I feel like she likes me but Im kinda nervous. The main reason for me being nervous is that she is about a year older than me, I’m 16 and she’s 17. I guess it seems like girls tend to like guys that are older than them not ones that are younger so it seems weird to me but it really shouldn’t. 

Still I’m like 90% sure that she likes me. She gets really nervous around me. Me and my friends would hang out after school and whenever she went somewhere she would ask me to go with her. She would always try to sit next to me and when she did she would move her leg over so that it was touching mine. 

So she definitely likes me right?

I’m almost certain she does. 

So now that I’ve figured that out I was hit with this wave of confidence and I’m thinking that I should try to flirt with her a bit but I don’t want to be too obvious.

A little background: I dated a girl for a year and neither of us were that good of people, I was considerably worse but we were both manipulative, we both lied and we cared more for ourselves than the other.

The breakup cost me all my close friends and I had nobody to rely on so I went about it in unhealthy ways, not eating for days, commenting on her posts in alt accounts, self harming and considering suicide. I eventually got to the point where I could live semi healthily after I apologized to her and we had one final conversation that went well and ended with us both apologizing to each other for what we'd done but it was online and we hadn't seen each other in person for months. She really did take a toll on me even though I knew I was worse than her and I ended up attempting suicide last Monday via overdose and after spending some time in a Psychiatric hospital I was transferred out of the school I was in and into another.

"Trying to get away from my suicide thoughtsI'm suicidal and trying desperately to hold on to life by searching up ways to talk to somebody face to face. But, in my country, they seem to have made so the only way to talk to anybody is by calling or texting, especially with the recent pandemic procedures. I understand the reason why those procedures are put in place but I don't want to talk to another fucking screen like I have been doing for almost 6 months. I need to have an actual conversation face to face with a professionnal or god knows anybody who would know what to do in this case. Plus I still live with my parents who are unaware of my suicidal thoughts so calling the suicide support number would be embarassing (also considering I don't even know what they're going to do if I call them). Every day I have to study more and more hours since I never seem to find the motivation to keep studying the night before. My work schedule is like a fucking cycle; I start studying, confident that I'll actually get something going but my suicidal thoughts come yet again to bring myself down and wonder if anything I'm doing for my future is even worth it at this point. None of what I study I find interesting. In fact, I've lost myself so much I don't even know what are my interests or dreams, I guess they all faded away with time... It's even worse when I compare myself to my friends and my parents when they were my age (I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but I just cannot help it when the people around me are the only thing I focus on). My friends and my parents at my age are and were all hard workers and were able to do so much in so little time, while I can't even study for one hour without whining like a little bitch about how ""My LiFe iS HoRriBle AnD i'LL NeVeR dO aNyThInG ProDucTivE iN mY LifE"".

"I wish I was successfull at suicide 3 years agoWhere to even begin, 

Originally I made this account to tell someone my thoughts without actually having to see them, as you can see in the post history. It did help a bit, and I found out that expressing myself in ""sketches"",memes or these kind of posts does help.

To recap my previous posts, I tried attempting suicide 3 ish years ago when I was 16 due to a abusive/horrible mother with a father absent due to divorce, sadly I was unsuccessful but I moved away and took control of my life as I made friends, hobbies and worked out, grades were decent too I guess.

However, the past 3 years I had episodes every day, hallucinations, voices, break downs, mood swings, self harm to being frequently on the verge of suicide, with absolutely no reason.

Atleast 3 years ago I knew why I wanted to kill myself, but now i know nothing. Honestly it's getting to me lately, as recently I wrote a suicide letter and started researching on effective methods, and I'm becoming more and more unstable every day, one day it's going to happen and I hope soon tbh.

I mean, what do I lose? My friends obviously hate me (logically speaking this isn't true but thats how I constantly feel), I have nobody close except a best friend, but to be honest I started distancing myself, and maybe that's the way to make it less painless for all. Just isolate, let them forget me and do it. I uh don't know at the point. It's a nightmare, it just hurts living without a reason.

I just want someone to come to me, give me a hug and say ""it's ok"". But nobody will do that, cause no one knows how serious situation I am in. Nobody knows about the fact that right now I'm on the roof, on the edge specifically ready to jump off to the electric pole a few meters below.

"I thought it was a myth but it worked!! I’ve heard a few times from the internet that pirates wore eye patches to switch between light and dark. I thought it was clickbait garbage but it actually works!

I tried it (on accident) and it was freaking me out. So what I did was I was laying on my bed looking at my phone. My head was on my pillow and my left eye was completed covered by the pillow, so I was only looking with my right eye. I was like this for 30 minutes to an hour. Then I decided to fall asleep, so I got up to plug in my phone across the room and turn off the light. 

When I got up, my left eye (the one that was covered) hurt. I closed my left eye and had normal vision. But I opened my left eye and closed my right, everything was way too bright and blurry. I just kept my left eye shut until I turned off the light. 

Everything was totally dark and I couldn’t see anything. But when I opened my left eye, my vison got crazy. I closed my right eye. I could see in the dark!! When I only had my right eye open, I couldn’t see anything at all. I was freaking out and was worried I had gone blind in that eye! It took over 15 minutes for my right eye to adjust to the dark.

"My views are wrong so please correct me Earlier today I had posted something very unsavoury in the heat of anger and I had realised that it was a wrong thing for me to do. I will just rephrase what I had written there, and please just correct me where my ideals are wrong.

I strongly condemn the act of rape and harassment, and the fact that rape and toxic male behaviour has suddenly become so widespread is a matter of concern for everyone. But i feel that the common method of 'rip and tear them until they are no more' is highly ineffective. I feel that we must view this as a social and a psychological problem alongwith criminal behaviour.

It is my personal belief that very few people vecome evil on their own and most toxic behaviour can be traced back to social and environmental conditions. I had assumed that toxic male behaviour is due to three factors - a mainstream media strongly hostile to men, poor peer interactions which lead to alienation with females, and a male environment which emphasizes masculinity with how you treat females - particularly sexual activity. I had proposed a solution that women humanise themselves to men, they show that they are just as good and bad as men are. This way men would feel more open to interacting with them and toxic behaviour would be greatly reduced. One thing I forgot to mention in my previous post is to improve positivity among male-male conversations and to reform the definition of masculinity along the lines of feminist reform.

It amazes me how people don't start showing compassion for others until they think they're going to die. Show them that kindness and caring all the time. You can feel love and compassion for strangers. You don't have to know someone personally to care about them. Remember that.

"First time messaging her and I think it looks weird. I added my crush on Snapchat a few days ago. I have liked her for 3 years but it was just a little crush, since September last year my feelings have became stronger for her and my crush on her is quite big. 

We don't really talk in school, and my best friend is almost like my wingman because they talk all the time so I just get involved in their conversations. But we never speak just us two. 

Anyway, I click on the page to message her. This is my first time messaging her and I'm feeling a bit nervous. And what do I do? Write my message in the chat bar and then screenshot it and debate whether I send it (looking back I have no idea why I did this, if I was going to debate I could have done it a completely different way).

You might think, ""That's not bad!"" oh, but it is. It's Snapchat, the first thing see she's when she clicks on my name is ""Antony screenshotted the chat!"" 😑

I thought that I can't just leave that there because that's awkward, I'll just have to send the message. So I send, ""Hey, Got any good Netflix recommendations?""

Then I sent, ""I screenshot a notification and it appeared on here because it was on this page 😅"" Then I thought that that is the most unbelievable thing I can say about that, so I deleted the message. Completely forgetting that it appears that I have deleted a message.

It appears and I freak out again. I send,"" I accidentally screenshot before I sent the message, sorry 😅"" and left the chat.

The last thing I noticed was that she doesn't even have me added, so I sent these messages and she won't receive them until she adds me back. So when she adds me (assuming she does when we get back to school in 2 weeks), she'll get hit with all that.


TDLR: Accidentally screenshot before I sent a message to my crush, and it shows when you screenshot. I panic and send a message, then delete it because it sounded too weird, realised that it also shows when you delete a chat, send a final message and then realise she doesn't even have me added as friend.

"Giving away your kids game console because you thought they spend too much time on it is the most asshole thing a parent can do.

He has issues now whenever he gets something new he never uses it in fear she will give that away too.

So parents watching this, if you think your kid is spending too much time on a game don't give it away, limit their time on it to like an hour a day or something.

This story does have a happy end though, recently he moved out and is planning on going to a college WAY out of town.

So the origin of the universe is kinda fucking insane and makes little to no sense if you think about it. Like, the Big Bang happened, but what was before that? Where did it all come from?

I don’t get it, I honestly don’t know if anyone ever will get it. Even black holes are fucking insane. Information can’t be destroyed, but black holes destroy information. We have absolutely no idea what goes on inside of one because of that. Anti-matter should also exist in the universe according to math, but it isn’t here. The CMB gives us an insight into the beginning, after the Big Bang, but what was before it? Was it a singularity? If so, where did the matter from that singularity come from? Was there another universe before it, that all succumbed to gravity and fell back into itself? If that’s the case, how many universes have gone through their life cycles before?

Yesterday she hadn't text me from 4pm to 9pm so I knew something was up, I finally got it out of her, her mother had one of these freak attacks and she went into her bedroom and tried to OD.
Her mother came in in hysterics saying she's gonna call the police and all that.

I spent the whole night crying but she assured me she wasn't in the right mindset and that she won't do it again, I also asked out of interest when the last time she cut was and she said last week but it was the first time in a year. 
I love her with everything I have in me and I'm just afraid that one day I will get a call telling me she passed.

Also to note her real dad killed himself when she was 18 months, and she's going to Counselling for that.",,Depressed
"Here's a story I wrote in 8th grade about Bob the Builder and Fortnite Bob the Builder sat on his metal toilet that he stole from the homeless shelter.

""I need a new medium for construction."" He said discreetly to himself. 

""Oh I know!"" He yelled. The rumble of his manly voice shook the walls of his wooden shack that he stole from the backyard of the homeless shelter.

""I can build stuff in Fortnite battle royale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Bob the Builder shouted. His voice was soon drowned out by the sound of him farting excessively from the constipation he got after eating that doughnut he picked out of the dumpster from the homeless shelter. 

Bob the Builder walked out of his wooden shack and walked down the streets of the city. He walked over to the Fatman Homeless Center and pushed through the glass doors. He walked up to a random homeless guy who was sitting at a table and poking a live squirrel with his pencil. 

""Excuse me, ma'am? CAN I BORRRRROWWW DAT SQUIRRRLLLL DAT YOU HAAFF???"" Bob the Builder yelled violently. He had to be direct if he wanted to intimidate the homeless guy, who was very muscular as a result of all his bank robberies. 

""YESSSS DUUUUUDEEE!"" The homeless guy cried. He began shaking violently and fell out of his plastic folding chair. 

""Thank you ma'am"" Bob said casually. 

Bob grabbed the squirrel and ran across the street to the Apple store. He ran up to the clerk and yelled savagely at him. 

""GIVE ME APPLE PRODUCT TO PLAY FORTNITE ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" He shouted while shaking the squirrel in the clerk's face. 

""OH! Mommy save me!!!!!"" He whimpered. He pulled a big, red apple out of the trash can and tried to hand it to Bob.

Instead, the squirrel bit the apple with his strangely large mouth and started shaking the apple around. 

""NO! BAD SQUIRREL!"" Ranted Bob. He took the apple from the mouth of the squirrel and smashed the squirrel's head on the counter of the Apple store. The squirrel was unscathed, and he ripped off the fur on his chest to reveal a Superman outfit. 

""NO! IT'S SQUIRRELMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Screamed Bob. He pulled out his chainsaw and began trying to slice the squirrel in half. The squirrel used his laser vision and melted through the chainsaw.

Squirrelman then fired his laser vision at Bob's head. Luckily for Bob, his forehead had been buttered so much and was so shiny that the laser vision bounced off and hit Squirrelman in the face. Squirrelman suddenly began squeaking and blew up in a puff of feathers.

""FATALITY"" Said the announcer in the sky, who sounded an awful lot like the guy from Mortal Kombat. 

Bob went back to his shack with his big red apple. He pulled his pants down and sat on the toilet, since it was the only piece of furniture he had. Naturally, he began farting excessively. His farts were so powerful that the air made the toilet water splash onto Bob's butt. Bob was shaking the apple in his hands, yelling at it to try and figure out how to play Fortnite with it. He shook it so much that he dropped it between his legs, and it fell into the toilet. Bob stood up in a panic. Should he reach in with his hand to get his apple back? No, that was unsanitary! He had to do something that wouldn't get him dirty. Then he remembered how Squirrelman's laser vision bounced off Bob's shiny forehead. Maybe the same thing would work with the toilet? He pushed his head into the toilet and grabbed the apple with his mouth. He tried to pull his head out, but his head was too big and he got stuck.",,Anxious

"It's gonna turn out long, no tldr. I'm just putting some stuff from my mind in here, hope someone understands.Hi, SW. I've been here a couple of times before. None of them, including now, are directly related to my suicidal thoughts. In fact, I don't think I ever had them, not truly. I've held a loaded gun and contemplated it, but it wasn't like I didn't want to live. I was just indifferent.


Anyway, these days I have a great life, or at least that's what I tell myself. I live in a pretty house, have lots of nice friends I can trust, a beautiful girlfriend, just started Engineering school in one of the best universities in my country and am learning French in one of the best language course institutions in my state.


The thing is, for a few years, I haven't been feeling happy. I really have a great life, and I keep telling myself I can't say I'm not happy, because I have so much. But lately... It's been fucked up.


My whole life I was told by my family how smart I am, how my grades meant I was intelligent. I entered Engineering school, as mentioned, which in my country is kinda hard, but now I can't keep up. My grades are amongst the lowest. I haven't had true appetite for food for a few weeks. I only feel any joy around my friends and girlfriend, and even then, when they're telling stories, I always feel really bad because my life has been so uneventful. When they were going to parties, I was home on the Internet. My family can only be described as dysfunctional, and I don't trust them for almost anything(with reason).  


Right now, I've stopped studying because I didn't know something. My tests are tomorrow and after. I turned off my phone to see if my gf will call me, and thus, call her attention, even though I don't tell her how I truly feel. I'm just sitting in the dark watching time goes by, not even music lights me up right now. It's not that I want to die, it's just I want to skip to a better time in life. A time when I'm not a house-staying boring nerd anymore.


The only time I truly feel well is when I make someone happy. As in, not making people laugh,something cute for my gf. I mean getting the homeless some food, helping an old lady carry her bags randomly, take a blind man to his bus stop across the bus terminal. It's just, I don't even do *that* a lot.

"Here again. How utterly unsurprising.Hello once more SW... me again. Hopefully this time I won't be so long winded, hmm?

So... so I tried to do like some of you suggested, you know, print up all i'd posted at http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/blgm2/funny_im_usually_on_the_other_end_of_these/ but naturally I never actually did anything with it. Sat on my desk for a week maybe, one day I got so sick of it being there and reminding me of how fucking... well, anyway, I chucked it. Burned it first, that paranoid. Anywho, I thought I'd just bear my admittedly hefty load a bit longer and hope it got a bit lighter, but fuck knows it's only gotten a hundred times worse. Haven't taken up drinking again yet, but I've wanted to almost every single day since I posted... a couple of days I didn't I did have a couple of days when I felt really, really, really good. Like, 'conquer-a-mountain' good. I don't even know why, truth be told. Shit, maybe I *am* bipolar. Fuck knows by now I wouldn't be surprised... my moods swing so crazily these days it's little wonder I am as stable as I am... no, I'm not on mood stabilizers. No, I don't plan on going on any. Can't afford 'em, don't really want 'em.

At first I tried to get over my whole quasi-aphephobia, but that didn't last long. Progress? Ha! Good joke. It's so damned depressing and infuriating... do you have *any* idea what it is like to literally be unable to be close to someone in any sense of the word? Does anyone out there in the great echoing chamber of the internet? Do I care either way?

Anyway... relations with my family have become even more strained of late. Frankly, I'm sick of putting on a facade of love and care. I don't love them. I really don't. Maybe I'm a bad person for it, but I don't care about *that* either. I'm sick to death of all this, I really, really am... you know, I used to really want to come to college. I used to want to be a public defender, maybe, something like that... really help those people out. Now? I could still do it I guess... I'd be a pretty damn good one too. But I don't know if I care to at this point.

I used to be so damn certain about everything... now I feel so lost. Goals, desires, interests, curiosity... I used to have so much on my plate, I didn't know where to start; I'd just look on and relish everything I was going to try out. Now, I don't even see the allure of the meager portion I have forked onto my platter... god, I'm such a wreck these days. I like to think I've turned a new leaf, picked my self up and stopped acting like such an unbearable asshole, but truth be told it's all still bubbling under the surface. I'm the same cynical, misanthropic, bitter bastard I've been ever since Middle School. I'm just not as vocal as I used to be about it. For the first time this entire year at college, I snapped at someone. They asked me a completely innocent question, and I was in a bad mood, and I basically verbally ripped their goddamn throat out. Didn't even apologize initially, just stormed the fuck off. And when I did apologize, it was begrudgingly. I wasn't sorry, I did it out of obligation. It's irrational, I know; she asked me if I could help her out on some joke of a math problem, how could she possible have known that I'm not really myself at this point? But I don't care. I really just do not care. I feel bad about snapping at her, but not because of how she feels. I feel bad because it means all the pretty little dreams I'd had of ever having something even vaguely similar to a normal human relationship are bullshit. Complete, unmitigated bullshit. I'm never going to stop resenting people for all they can do and feel that I can't. I really, truly believe that this spite will only ever be dulled, at best.

I'm pissed of, SW; I'm angry at my parents for being such hypocrites, I'm pissed at my brothers for not seeing it, I'm pissed at my 'friends' because they don't understand me, I'm pissed at my professors for taking things so slowly, I'm pissed at my TA's for knowing the material worse than I do, I'm pissed at the whole goddamn world. I know it's stupid, why be mad at something beyond your control? But lord knows I am furious.

I'm about as furious as I am full of sorrow. It's odd... sometimes I am so completely overwhelmed by it, I can't even move. Sometimes it's just a low grade grind, just enough to make me sigh... and sometimes, like I said, I don't feel it at all. Sometimes I feel like goddamn king of the world. But most often its that intermediary despair; more than just the grind, but I can still function. I suppose some of my friends have begun to perk their ears up to it... innocuous questions, ""Are you ok?"" Ha! Yeah, I'm fan-fucking-tastic. What the hell does it look like? I'm pretty good at hiding my emotions, comes with 19 year's practice. So when something does leak out that shouldn't, I always think I'm glowing red or something, like the whole world can tell. So it's probably a sign if people are approaching me about this...

Hell, while I type this up right now, someone *just* came in my room and asked how I was. Out of the fucking blue... waved her off, of course. I don't think I can bear to talk about all this shit to a real person and not this beautifully anonymous mirror of the web. Maybe I'm a coward in that way. Again, in the spirit of what appears to be a recurring theme, I don't care.

I mean, how can? Where do I even begin? Do I tell them about how someone I knew committed suicide on me a day after I thought I'd talked him out of it? Do I tell them that afterwards, I didn't feel a thing? And even now, only the tiniest twinge? Do I tell them I think I'm crazy? That sometimes I swear I see or hear something I *know* can't be there? It's stupid I know it is... I go on these long walks, and I see things in the darkness. It's human, everyone does it... but I wish I knew if everyone saw it in the same detail... maybe I've just got an over active imagination... I was walking on a bridge the other night, and I swear I saw myself standing on the ledge, wearing all white. And the me that I saw gave me a lazy salute and just fell off. Voluntarily, but he didn't jump, he just let gravity take him... it was eerie as *hell*. Maybe it's all subconscious. I don't know. But it gets to me sometimes, when I can't just brush it off.

So... so yeah. I don't really know what to tell you all, if you are even still listening at this point. I feel like my whole life is crumbling around me, and I feel like I don't even have a 'whole life' to *have* crumble around me. I'm still not all that close to anyone. I don't think I ever will be. I'm still only just hanging on a thread, here and alive for little better reason than I'd rather not be responsible for some poor bastard cleaning up whatever mess I leave when I die. I'm not happy, and I thought I was ok with that. But now I don't know *what* I'm ok with... I'm drowning here, SW, I really am. And I'm not sure I care enough to keep swimming. I haven't eaten in... shit, a day at least. Closer to a day and half. Slept an hour last night. I'm exhausted, but can't sleep... I'd drink it all away, but something is holding me back. I don't know what, maybe deep down that sonofabitch Schopenhaur was right and there is a will to live. Frankly, I don't give a damn.

Feel free to critique me. Honestly! You aren't going to push me over the edge, unlike some people who post here :(. So if you care to comment, tell me what you think. Be honest, I am; reciprocate the courtesy, if you don't mind. Odds are I still won't trust a word any of you say, but... I don't know, maybe this will help. Probably not, but that's better than definitely not. Fuck, I'm rambling now... sorry about that. Anyway, I'm another twenty-something with little hope for the future on a micro or macro level, lost drive, lost desires, lost *everything*. I'm just so tired of it all... sick of preachers, teachers, beachers, leechers...

It lowers your natural dopamine levels, and your normal masculine drive. It also has been shown to damage your brains frontal lobe which impairs rational thinking and decision making. Is that temporary pleasure really worth it? Is it worth an imbalance of hormones and increased rate of depression? Is it worth damaging your self confidence? Is it worth the impaired decision making? Is it worth that feeling of disgust you get afterwards? If you answered yes, then I'm afraid you can't be helped. It's no coincidence that your ancestors achieved great things when porn wasn't a thing. Do you really think that the men who charged Normandy would have done so if they had constant access to pornography? We need you to be that strong man that your forefathers were. Do it so further down the line, you can look back on yourself and thank yourself. Do it for your future children or grandchildren. Be a strong person. Conquer your urges.",,Anxious

"My dad just called a book about LGBTQ people who changed history that I got from my teacher 'garbage' and a 'waste of my time and education'. Over the summer, I joined a book club that was being organized by my teacher. One of the books that she chose was a book called Queer, There and Everywhere by Sarah Prager. (It's a really great book. I learned a lot.) However, I wasn't finished with it once the book club ended, since we'd been mostly focusing on the other book we were reading, so I decided to keep it for a little while longer so I could read it all the way through. A month or so afterwards, we got switched to full online/remote learning because of a spike in Covid cases where we live. That was a few weeks ago, and my dad just found the book.

The first thing he said when he saw it was, ""What is this garbage?"" Then he went on to say that   
""\[teacher's name\] is wasting my time and education"" by letting me read that book. Not 'making'- 'letting'. He's angry I was given *permission* to read it. He's been yelling about it for a good while, and he's threatened to pull me out of that teacher's class, and based on when he's done this sort of thing in the past, he might make good on it, and that would be horrible for me, since that's one of the only classes I take that I enjoy. My mom's angry about it too, but she's screaming at me for other reasons.

"I'm out of options. 2nd suicide attempt is all I have left.I was doing fine and had a steady job working 11 hours a day doing physical labor with a wood working company. I used 3 PTO days in a row with the excuse of being sick. Turns out I need to get a docs net when sick for 3 days. Didn't have my medical information as I've only been working there 4 months and I didn't get a medical card yet through the company. No money in the bank so couldn't pay the $125 to see a doc for 5 mins to tell him I was sick last week and just need a docs note so I can go back to work. Poor communication between my employer and myself throughout this time resulting in me  becoming very stressed at the thought of losing my job after about a week of not working. End up getting a temp med card printed out and getting the docs note and go back to work. Didn't know I was even going to end up keeping this job at this point so I had already planned to take my final check and use the money to get to a bridge near me and jump(no car so would take bus). So stressed and still suicidal first day back at work I end up walking off the job at first break without saying a word. Almost turn back but I just keep walking home and heavily regret it instantly. Contact my employer and tell them I'm going through stress and I've made a mistake( Without a car this employer is my only option in my area). Now I'm hanging in limbo as I await my employer to contact me next week with their decision to give my job back or not. Even if they do I will be ashamed to show my face at work since I missed so much work last week and all my co workers know I just walked out the first day I got back. All my co workers primary language is Spanish and mine is English so I'm all alone at work so it's easy to get stuck in my head and get in a bad mind set. I have poor education and no skills or options left. Not a single family member, and not a single friend to talk to.

"Life is so just so hard.It's not hard in the sense to me of eventually being able to live on my own or 'make it' per se. It has been hard in different ways for me. It all really comes to friendships and relationships. I've always been an awkward person, I guess you can say, perhaps a bit shy. But if people ever gave me a chance, I feel I was decent at conversing and being a good person. The friends I had from high school, we all pretty much went are different ways, and now I don't really have that much friends. Moreover, I am starting at UC San Diego as a senior (skipping junior year by taking many classes), and I want to finish as soon as possible because I am 23, and I am a math major, so I essentially will be studying everyday for the next 350 days. So I am older than most of my peers, so I feel it would be very hard to find a good friendship here at UC San Diego.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, with respect to relationships...they have been bad besides my last one.

Essentially, I met all 4 of my relationships online from dating apps, either ok cupid or meetme. the first 3 relationships...well they all cheated on me. The fourth relationship I had, it was amazing, but I fucked it up big time. I was insecure and mean to her a lot because I was just facing issues. I just feel I fucked it up so much. She is such an amazing women, and I really hope she finds a guy to love her for her because she was the best thing that ever happened to me and I just feel horrible. She cut all contact with me, rightfully so. I am not going to stalk her or be a crazy person and make a fake account to add her or something or use a fake number. As much as I just want to talk to her again and hear her voice one more time, I know it is over. I would wait forever for this lady, but I know she is so amazing, that she will probably find someone else within a couple of months.  I just kind of don't want to live anymore. People will always say there is someone better out there for you. But is that really true? She was non-materialistic, kind, nice, funny, loving, everything you would want in a lady and I ruined it. Given after this year I graduate, and then I either work or go to a masters program, and then find a good job, I will have a good job and a good livelihood, which is what we all aim for as humans, but this hurts the most.

"Day seven of posting until a homophobe makes a well conceived argument free of falacies Psa: homophobia is a term used to describe a mindset in which one acts or reacts adversely to homosexuals or (in some cases) toward any member of the lgbtq+ community

I have recently seen several occasions where people misuse this term. Whether it is as joking as 'its just a home why would I be afraid of it' to undeniable homophobes saying and I quote (with censoring)  ""why would I be afraid of f***"" this is an issue not only because it makes it harder to debate, but more importantly it trivializes homophobia in all cases. 

In other news I have given up reading the Bible, because I have realized arguments based on religion are flawed for reasons I can understand without having read the entire religious works of said religions. For example, leviticus 20:13 (a very commonly used passage to justify homophobia) can easily be debated against if the person citing it doesn't believe cheating on a spouse should be punished by death. That is unless they can provide an inherent reason for which they believe the moral and not the punishment (feel free to take a swing at this).

Even though I've been depressed for a long while now and know I want to end my life eventually (I can't see myself an old man) knowing I had the power to end it all finally really put things in perspective.

I'm not afraid of dying.

The biggest issue for me is I don't want to feel like I'm living my life for anyone else but me and to be honest I'm not happy 75-90% of the time.

"One More DayI've posted many times before on r/anxiety, r/depression, and here on r/suicidewatch. Occasionally, I'd post a morbid, but truthful response on r/askreddit to see what the average joe had to say.

I'm not going to go into details about my situation right now. If you're curious, either ask specific questions so I don't have to retype many paragraphs, or dig up some of my previous posts.

Anyway, to sum it up, I've wanted to kill myself for a long time. About 3 years I'd estimate, although I've considered it my whole life. I've never sought real life help because I don't want to be stopped from killing myself, and I've never tried because I don't want to fail and be discovered. This all changed about a month ago when I discovered a method that didn't have as high a success rate as I like, but I have the materials, and if I fail, nobody has to know I attempted.

I haven't had an opportunity, but tomorrow night I'll have a 17 hour window where nobody is obligated to know where I am. This will give me ample time to kill myself, or alternatively replace the materials and hide any trace.

I just took a walk in the cold, and did a lot of thinking. I came to conclusion that I should still try and kill myself, and do one last consideration if it looks like I can be successful.

Tomorrow I will continue the normal routine of doing a bunch of school work, anxiety driven to continue to do well at this damn academy with an undesirable, equally anxious future ahead and nothing to look forward to but escapism.

I have a little over 24 hours until I will attempt. If anyone has anything I haven't heard or considered before, (and believe me, I've lurked the likes of these long enough to hear a lot,) I'll be willing to discuss it.

For the first time in a long time I feel as if I have power of my situation. I feel sort of happy. This is a passing opportunity, however - I won't be able to go on if I know I just passed it up. I need to try and kill myself - I want death so badly.

I don't care who I'll hurt. I don't care what I'll miss. I don't care what comes after death, and I certainly don't care what I'll leave behind. This action is illogical, but no more so than life itself. I do not need an explanation for my actions, any more than you'd question a man for choosing to get vanilla ice cream over chocolate. It is as much my right to die as it is my right to live. I'm going to kill myself tomorrow, or at the very least, I'm going to try.

EDIT: I'm still here. To whoever managed to trace my IP and call my school... thank you, I guess. I'm still kind of in shock right now, but it seems like things might get better. I guess I was unable to ask for help, but now the ball is rolling. Thank you.",,Depressed

"I HATE The 2020 &amp; 2021 Bad Memes EDIT: This was originally meant to be posted on r/unpopularopinion however they said my post was too similar to others so I decided to post my grievances here, sorry for the essay lol but hey if you're here, it's obviously to hear what I have to say so let's get into it.

\- 

To quote Roger Ebert (kind of) "" I hated this meme, hated, hated, hated, hated this meme, HATED IT, hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it. "".

To explain what I mean by ""2020 &amp; 2021 bad"" I refer to all the memes out about how 2020 and 2021 were bad years and that's pretty much all the meme/joke is about. It's like ""oh this bad thing happened"" and that's funny somehow.

I guess it was funny a little at first like haha 2020 is the worst year ever but at this point it is quite possibly the most annoying thing on the planet to me &amp; I cannot be alone here.

Just to point out ""hey this year hasn't been great so far and the year before it was bad and here's a bad thing that happened that makes this year bad"" and think that's funny. Again maybe at first but that's all almost any meme or joke is now, it's all anyone talks about, I feel like AVGN in the sports games review ""2020, 2020, 2020, 2020"", it's all I hear.

And it's not only that, it's that these memes are probably not good for people mentally, I feel they probably create some anxiety, just to focus on the negative side of everything in the form of a joke still has to not be good for you right?

In any case these memes are so very annoying and have gone on for far, far too long, they aren't funny anymore, they're repetitive, annoying, have overstayed their welcome and should go die.

Also here's that fun clip of Roger Ebert I was quoting from: [Enjoy](https://youtu.be/982R2eAhL54?t=76)",,Anxious
"I can't love or be lovedWhether it is giving or receiving, I'm too void emotionally to be human. This depression isn't situational. Nothing happened or there is no story, really. I'm just mentally very, very unwell with a long history of medication, hospitalizations and treatment 



""It gets better"" is a phrase that is laughable. It's been a slow downhill trajectory for 18 some years. Now, I'm alone, homeless, passion-less and held hostage by addiction that robs 5-10 or more hours of my life every day. I'm missing therapy appointments because I'm too exhausted and oversleeping. I've had HR talk to me. I'm sleeping with vomit splatters.



In January, I hope I muster the courage to make the decision I know I need to. My sister just had a baby and my only concern is how the whole being dead thing is going to take a toll. She lives 13 hrs away and will probably be in charge of funeral/memorial issues. Maybe I'll die closer to home, who knows. 



I want to be forgotten, just cremated and gone in a blink. But funerals or for the living. And while death is my choice, I have no say in what should be done the moment I am gone. 



I so badly wish I could die with inner peace and dignity. I want someone to hold my hand and respect and understand and let me go. 



But instead, I will opt for a moldy motel. But I guess it's a fitting place.",,Depressed

"Uno reverse on the wannabe bully (wannabe tough guy) (TL;DR in the end) I was telling this to a friend when I decided... frick it, I'm posting it on reddit.

So basically the wannabe tough guy in my class is trying so hard to keep his grip that he thinks he ever had on the class... and has tried multiple times to make me feel inferior (but I ain't taking no bullshit)

First time idek what he was saying but basically trying to call me gay, so my response was ""I'm sorry for disappointing you but I prefer women, I didn't know you liked men tho""

And another day I still don't remember what he was saying but he had been quite in the class and suddenly decided to start making fun of me so my natural response was ""you finally woke up!"" You know bcs he went from hiding in his desk while using his phone to suddenly come up with his crap

The next day his ""friend"" (which I'm 100% sure he only stays with him so he doesn't get bullied by him) was kinda struggling with basic things in class, and a girl said he forgot to take his meds, I said he accidentally took his grandmother's meds instead of his and the whole class started laughing. He (probably anxious asf) said ""are we supposed to laugh now?"" And I replied with ""we already are laughing"" 

Now before you may think that I bully people on a daily basis... I don't... I usually let people be and although I may be loud and laughing all the time with my friends I don't bother others

So there's that girl who I met at a party on saturday evening. I really liked her and almost got to the point of kissing her and having nice time together but my friend's mom had to pick us up before I could. After the party I talked to her by message pretty briefly and only talked about what happened with another friend of mine when I left. Ok and? Well now the stupid thing is that if I wanna go further and try to start a relationship I must talk to her by message cause we aren't in the same school and I don't have much time to pass by her school.

 QUESTION: So now, my idiot ass doesn't know what to send her as 1st message and what to talk about after. Any advice?

"13 yo treating mother like one of his dudes Any advice on how to manage this situation would be appreciated. I work a lot but I am also very present and always talk to him about any subject he is interested in, he has a lot of freedom (plays video game one hour on weekdays, on weekends it is free, access social media daily, has an iphone) but the only chore he is really asked to do is to pick the 6 yo at school because it is on his way back. He totally thinks this is so much effort and always complains about it. I am not the kind of mother who punishes, sometime I make him stay without the video game for a day and then it is the only moment he comes to say he is sorry and to have the punishment waived.  

Today at the dinner table he started joking that I sound like an old cranky lady because I was asking if the small one wanted to have some more food. Then he laughed a lot when I asked why he thinks I am an old cranky lady, the younger one started laughing with him and I felt totally lost, I mean, I have 4 boys from 13 to 3 yo and he is the oldest, taller than me, this is the example he is giving his siblings. 

I remember it is not easy to be a teenager but if I had this kind of behaviour my mother would punch my attitude out of my s so I was afraid of her. He is not afraid of me because I am not violent. I feel that the only thing he and the others respect here is the video game.",,Anxious

"My first post here.        So I am a 2 time cancer survivor at 14. No, I’m not kidding. When I was 12 in 2018, I was experiencing severe pain in my right hip along with high fevers. I saw doctors who said I was being lazy, or it was growing pains. I missed days of school because the pain was too much to handle. Finally, after about 6 months of experiencing it I was scheduled an MRI. I was diagnosed on October 26, 2018 at the age of 13. It turned out to be Ewings’ Sarcoma, a bone cancer common in teens and young adults. People say I should have been diagnosed sooner because I had every symptom and I was the exact type of person who would get it. I went through the chemo and radiation because surgery would be potentially fatal for me. I handled it decently well, and I definitely grew as a person in general. From shy and quiet to cheerful and talkative. I finished Ewings’ treatment on August 26, 2019. I got my medals, t-shirt, rang the bell, and went back to normal life. It was great! Everyone said I changed in a good way, and I was happy to have that boringness back! 
       Then on December of 2019, I had my check up scans done to see if cancer was coming back. I was called back after Christmas for some more scans because they saw something that wasn’t a result of past treatments. It turned out to be cancerous, and I had a biopsy done. They were expecting Ewings’, but it was ALL Leukemia. This was January 3 of 2020. They were surprised because there has not been a recorded case of someone having Ewings’ then getting ALL Leukemia. They were a little relieved, though, because ALL Leukemia is one of the high survival rates cancer in children. I started chemo on January 8, 2020. I was lucky they caught it early because that meant that I didn’t have to stay in the hospital for a month. Only two weeks! I found out that I needed a bone marrow transplant later due to the fact that my body was still very weak from prior treatment, and the fact that I had this as my secondary cancer. My Leukemia wasn’t super hard to achieve remission, but the transplant would be the only sure way to get rid of everything completely. A body reset. Leading up to the transplant, the hospital attempted more chemo on me. One two week stay in the hospital with angry kidneys and a deadly allergy attack from a chemo which landed me in the ICU later, I was just put on a very small amount of chemo each week until transplant. 
            I went in for transplant on April 30, 2020. I had chemo plus radiation to kill of my old cells, and make room for new cells. I got my transplant on May 6, 2020 by 2 umbilical cords. I felt weird, but fine for the next week, then I got engraftment syndrome. It isn’t actually a medical illness, but it is what we call when you start showing signs of engraftment. You will know when you are engrafting because the pain is horrible! It also came with loss of appetite, nausea, weakness, and other fun stuff! I was on a morphine drip, and asked for benadryl every so often. I didn’t sleep for about 3 days straight. Because of the coronavirus, I wasn’t allowed any visitors beside a select few hospital staff. Thanks anti-maskers for making sure that 4 kids all under the age of 16 weren’t allowed to see their families during the worst part of their lives! I ended up being so mentally messed up that the unit was allowed to have a therapist come and visit instead of doing tele med. It was all worth it though because after 35 days in the hospital, I was allowed to leave cancer free! My muscles ached so badly though, I could only walk a few minutes at a time very slowly. Transplant is such a surreal experience because you can feel everything that is going on in your body. Pretty hard to describe. 
           I still had to stay in a hotel nearby the hospital because they want you close by in case if something happens. I only got one fever, which they still don’t know what caused it, and a few graft versus host rashes. I was doing so well that they let me go home early. After 92 days total, I got to sleep in my own bed for the first time! I still have to go to the hospital once a week for check ups. Right now, I am got my Ewing’s MRI done which showed what they think is radiation scarring so I’m not too worried about it. The radiation oncologist said it did look like delayed scarring, and it was in the exact place where scarring would show up. I am also getting a lot of post 100 days transplant tests done at the moment. All of which with good results. 
        I posted this just to say enjoy the little moments. We all take stuff for granted, and I got it all swept away from me in an instant. I used to be able to jump, walk without a limp after exercise, spend time with friends, celebrate holidays, and go to school. I have been wearing masks since 2018, and now I have to when I go to the gym during slow hours. I am feeling a lot better physically and mentally than 4 months ago. I’ve completely changed as a person from 6th to 9th grade, and I’m grateful. Not for the cancer, but what it made me. I met some of the best people in my life from doctors, nurses, and other patients. I have made some lifelong friendships. I was opened up to many opportunities that I never thought I would do before. I am actually a bit of a mentor now to kids that get recently diagnosed because I have so much experience. I have met kids who won’t live to be 20, and ones who passed in my treatment. I am just grateful that I got off lucky so many times so far. I see life in a new angle. We all live our own lives, and all feel differently. Really the best thing to do for someone is understand them. Stay safe, and enjoy yourself and those around you. If you like to hike, then hike. I you like to be alone, then be alone. Just enjoy those happy moments. I don’t know how to share pictures on a post, but if I did it would most likely be my cancer medals. I hope you all can believe this, but I understand if you don’t.",,Anxious

My only solace was in philosophy. Though much research I found meaning in a meaningless world. But, all good things must end I suppose. I sit here watching the sunrise thinking about everything. I'm not depressed, or mad. I just know the ending to a movie, and I slowly watch as more people leave the theater, knowing its about time for me to leave too. And I'm just not sure if I should keep being the absurd man(see Absurdism). I've tried to find meaning in love but it slowly become a chess match, of which I usely know her next move and it becomes a bore. I end up destroying the relationship to just she if I know her as well as I think I do. spoiler I do, every time. I've tried nonprofit jobs/volunteering, and I slowly build in rage due to others incompetence. Not from the lack of knowledge, but from the acceptance of their stupidity, and lack of willingness to learn and adapt.

don’t you hate it when your parents displace their problems onto you in a manner that isn’t the friendliest and their reactions towards you reflect that and you’re left to just feel bad about yourself because all you want is to make them happy but when they lash out on you like that it makes you question if you’re good enough??

don’t you hate it when you think you’re happy and you’re doing okay but one thing just makes you crumble and fall apart but you can’t cry or show it around your parents because they get mad at you for crying so you bottle up your emotions only to scream and cry into a pillow hours or days later because you kept it in for so long?

don’t you hate it when you’re fearful of making a silly mistake infront of your parents and then they go apeshit on you and so instead you purposely isolate yourself from them because you’re scared of fucking up lol

don’t you hate it when you try to ignore the negative feelings and you try to be strong and you are strong for a bit but then it just breaks apart and you’re left vulnerable and then you wonder if you think you’ll have a relapse of [redacted] and it’s hurting you so badly

"Real Talk: The Suicide Hotline sucks. Let me explain why.A couple months ago I almost killed myself. Went to the ER then was put into a psych ward the whole sha-bang. The one thing I look back on was the moment before I was about to make my attempt was the call I made to the suicide hotline. Was the wait long, yes. Doesn’t matter. The called was connected a good 40 mins later and I was speaking to a very nice woman. 

I felt uncomfortable I guess. I told her what was happening and she got very quiet. She didn’t really know what to say or what to tell me. In the awkward silences I would speak up so it would be too awkward but then it would just end up with me rambling. She would try to refer to places to go but she didn’t really know what exactly to do due because of the differences in states. I’m not saying the hotline is bad just that, it was like being forced to talk to family you don’t want to talk to. Very awkward and uncomfortable. Didn’t make me change my mind at all, and actually made me feel bad for putting her in this position. I ended the call saying I feel better and will go to the hospital so she can hang up with the idea that I would be okay. Yeah I just need to end the awkwardness as fast as possible. I’m still here now. Surprisingly, but things haven’t changed for me sadly. ",,Depressed

"Pt2 to another redditors rant        A while ago on r/teenagers I saw a post about that fat kids are fat because of their parents because they don't listen to their kids that they are full and that they don't need more food, I blew it off as ""yeah whatever"" until today. For context I have been in a growth spurt for the past 3 years and have grown average of 3.5 inches per year, eating like crazy whilst keeping a good body.

       for the past couple days I have been feeling less hungry and today I got open about it and I finished my meal 3/4 the way through  and said I'm full; I usually finish my meal the fastest and my sister finishes last, I wait until the end of dinner, because I thought that they understood that I was full, and I didn't have to finish it (my sister often doesn't eat all her food and gives it to my stepdad), so I thought I was fine.

         Dinner is being cleaned and My stepdad looks at my plate and says ""why haven't you eaten all your food"" I say ""I'm not hungry"" he stands up and starts yelling at me, my mom advocates for me and says he isn't hungry.

       Mom takes him into their room and I hear the most fucking angry tone anyone could hear yelling ""what the fuck he hasn't said I'm not hungry in forever, why is he not hungry now"" he comes out, mom in tears, and fuckin yells at me again ""you fuckin eat your food or I'm taking your phone, xbox, and you're grounded for a month.

"“Kind Stranger” has struck again... In the early hours of the morning, an anonymous Gold Award giver by the name of “Kind Stranger” gave several posts these awards with seemingly no motive. The identity of the mysterious being is unclear, and users are asked to be aware of their surroundings in these dark times. Kind Stranger could be anywhere.

This is obviously not the first time that this has happened. A series of particularly suspicious attacks took place less than a month ago, each involving a basic post being ambushed with Platinum and Gold Awards, along with all of its comments. All that we do know about the criminal is that they never give to people who beg for gifts.

Kind Stranger seems to have a suspiciously bottomless pit of coins to spend, which is why we must take them down and work out how they managed to obtain them. I and a team of willing volunteers will be monitoring posts over the next few days, hoping to catch the criminal in the act. However, if this method fails, we will not hesitate to widen our search.

"I am inexorably going to kill myself soon.Hi, everyone,  

  

I know it's a bit of a delicate subject and I'm not going to go into detail because unfortunately the situation is complex and even I would have a hard time describing what's happening to me; I'm not one of those people who have a lot of problems.  

  

Since last August, I have been officially calling myself depressed. I used to get depressed a lot in the past, but this is now a permanent situation. A ""functional"" depression since the autopilot starts as soon as I get up on Monday morning and ends on Friday afternoon, when I'm finally done with my 9-5. From then on I find myself in a total depression, with constant death wishes that clearly will take me to the grave sometime soon.  

  

I am seeing a therapist but unfortunately it doesn't change anything. I don't feel anything negative as soon as I walk out the door. It's always the same for me. As soon as I start talking to someone about it, my old instincts prevent me from feeling empathy towards myself and I treat the situation as if it were temporary. Or without really being able to convey the urgency of my condition. I'm no longer afraid of death or pain at all.  

  

Nothing seems to work. I am gradually detaching myself from everything that connects me to life, except running and sleeping, during which I float.  

  

I'm just getting a little tired of always believing that it's going to get better soon. It's been like this for years.",,Depressed

And any new ones I’ve just pushed away, If I were to die now who would come to my Funeral? My mother? My father? Any relatives? No I would just be another statistic for the world to scoff at.

"I feel invisibleIt was my birthday the other week and I am not a big birthday person. I don't have it on social media etc. But not even my closest friends, some I've known for more than 13 years, remembered my birthday other than one person and my immediate family. Am I selfish for thinking they should remember? Or is it okay to be upset? I can name more than a dozen of my friends birthdays and I often send cards and so on. But am I being selfish?

It got me thinking back to a couple of years ago when I tried to hurt myself and I didn't want to tell anyone because I thought that everyone has their own problems. People say that those who self-harm are attention seeking and everyone now gets tainted with that brush. So I didn't want to give the wrong impression because I guess I care what people think. But I did it because it made me feel a sense of calm and relief in a strange way that nothing else did. 

I often think I could take my own life but I just could never follow through. I also think that very few people would actually notice. Do you ever feel you're there for other people but they are never there for you? I always feel like a friend but never the best friend, you know? Sorry to ramble.

"Everything is a mess!My entire life is a mess. 

I have a well paying job that I hate. I'm fairly certain my company is going to go bankrupt soon. The writing is on the walls for sure. There have been mass layoffs, including my work best friend who was honestly like a father figure to me. I still talk to him, but it's not the same as seeing him on a regular basis. The people left at the company are all miserable and fear for their jobs. The surrounding negativity is making my depression 100x worse. 

I'm looking for other jobs, but haven't had any luck yet. Found one that was decent, but I would have had to almost cut my pay in half, which I simply cannot do. 

Despite having a decent salary, I can't seem to save money. Things always pop up (vet bills, higher than normal electric bills, car stuff, etc). My emergency fund is always gone as a soon as I reestablish it.

I hate my apartment. I loved it at one point, then awful neighbors moved in and construction began outside my window (There are multimillion dollar homes being built right next to my complex). This construction is literally 7 days per week, 16 hours per day. I can never sleep! It's causing me to become increasingly irritable. I've spent almost $300 trying to buy noise canceling products. Oh, and I woke up to all of the gas siphoned from my car on Friday...

I asked about switching to another unit, but it would be a $400 transfer fee and higher rent. I want to just break the lease, but it'll be a $2,000 fee. 

I don't have too many friends these days. Most of them are married and have kids, but I chose my career. I'm slowly catching up, I don't think I realized how lonely a career focused life would be. 

I also feel like everyone who knows me is always annoyed with me.

"The inevitableTwo major causes for issues right now. Written as two separate paragraphs.

At about the age of 12 I felt that sinking feeling that I really was gay, and not just confused. Shortly after that I became a closeted proud gay teen waiting for the right time to come out. As time went on I began to feel more and more depressed and started cutting my arm. This whole time I was feeling further and further away from God, and not because I felt he abandoned me, but that I abandoned Him. I hadn't been to Church in 6 six years save for special holidays or funeral's. I got back into churchand started really praying and studying into what God was showing me on homosexuality. I had decided that the best way for me to honor the Lord was to pursue a celibate lifestyle. As time went on I got more involved within the body of Christ. Over the past few years things have gotten back to me desiring a family, but knowing that I could never marry a woman, and that I promised God I wouldn't partake in gay relationships. I am now 31 years old and realizing that I will grow old alone.


Since I was in 7thbor 8th grade I was sent to see a shrink and my dad was told that I had ADHD and I was put on Adderall, Zoloft, Wellbutrin at different times....in school I always seemed to repel people and the few that could tolerate me I stuck like glue to until I pushed them away as well. I could never focus and take in what the teachers were talking about. I could however tell you all about Corvettes in minute details. Or exactly which TV shows were on which channel at what time for that week. Just recently I was made aware of the fact that I am likely on the Autism Spectrum rather than ADHD or just bring a weirdo like I thought I was.

It feels like there are three options. 

A) grow old alone being the gay ASD weirdo that annoys people (same as now but old) Die one day and be with God

B) continue to fight the depression battle until one day I succumb to my own hand. Die and be separated from God.

C) quit being celibate... hopefully obtain a partner... hopefully depression lightens...die one day and be separated from God

Long story short. On Tuesday all of my classmates were hating on wearing masks to school on the group chat so when i saw that i snapped. I wrote a letter long text saying how irresponsible they were and if they don't like the conditions, they can just do online school (and many more arguments). I spent a while on that text so I expected some sort of response. No one said anything. No one said I was right or wrong, not even my friends. I was very much ignored. 

Fun part of the story starts now. Today a popular classmate of mine, whom everyone loves, posted THE EXACT SAME THING I POSTED as a facebook comment on a post hating on the current conditions at school. It had the exact same arguments I made!!! And guess what happened, you're right, she got so much positive attention from that! My classmates were agreeing with her, congratulating her for speaking up.

The thing that annoys me the most is that the conversation was ended by her saying ""i had to say something"". OH MY GOD THE AUDACITY ON THIS BITCH TO SAY THAT. YOU STOLE MY TEXT

"I don't really know how to start[I'm moving my post from the depression subreddit because I noticed that it's probably better here instead of there, as stated by the guidelines, which I should have read all of before posting. Sorry.]

I guess I kinda want to start by saying I know A LOT of people are depressed. I know how I feel is no different from so many others, and I even know some of those people who are like me did manage to get better. Yet for some reason, that info doesn't bring me any happiness. All I have is a sort of lost feeling.

In school I was always a below average student, the teachers always said I had ""lots of potential but no drive"". Which, let's be honest, they tell everyone that lol. Only the cruelest teachers don't, and I did have a few of those myself, but they just never acknowledged me. I graduated High School back in 2012, and I've yet to even sign up for college because frankly, I know I can't do it. I've lost all confidence in myself to excel in an such an environment, especially since as I mentioned, school was never something I was good at, or enjoyed.

I've tried my hand at a lot of other creative skills I used to love, but I always seem to fall short, though I admit it's because I quit too soon. However now I can't even enjoy art or writing anymore because I just remember how terrible I am at it. I've tried a couple of jobs, but again, I can't seem to commit. I'm terrified of people being disappointed in me. Since both jobs were pretty much given to me by my friends, I know very well what an idiot I was for missing a golden opportunity, one people my age shouldn't pass up no matter how little the pay was.

I live with my grandmother and mom, which is no surprise to you reading this by now. I'm a leech and I know by conversations I overhear her having with my aunt, my grandmother is disappointed in how I turned out. All she does is make me feel stupid when I talk to her because my Spanish is so broken and I'm too scared to try and pronounce some words without sounding like an idiot. My mother is a mess too, she works very hard at a job she hates and talks about killing herself whenever she's depressed or drunk. All that said, I love them with everything I am. They're my family, all I have, and I'm hurting them. Our financial issues are so bad, we're teetering on the brink of being out of a home in a few weeks because our landlord randomly decided to raise our rent.

So why have I waited so long? Well the only reasons I haven't killed myself yet is because of my friends and family. Another is my girlfriend. I've been told I have helped them all before, through something, anything. The only thing that keeps me going is helping them because they don't know how much they've helped me. But I've come to the conclusion, seeing all these people, they're so strong. Much stronger than me. They would have gotten through this without me, no doubt. They have other friends, they're good people, and they have strong wills. They didn't need me. But I need them.

And let's face it. They'll all move on eventually. I'm not sure this relationship with my girlfriend will last once she realizes who she's being anchored down with, and my friends will get sick and tired of my self pity nonsense. My family are already tired of me.

What's the point? When does this get better? When do I stop feeling this sharp pain that makes me want to stop breathing(excuse the melodrama)? I want to cry every week, happiness feels more like a distraction than an emotion, and it never lasts long. I just want to try and feel good about myself for once, but I always feel slower, weaker and lower than everyone around me.

My grandmother would never allow me to get on medication, and I'm against it myself. So what other option do I really have? Should I just wait till everyone stops caring like I expect, and then just kill myself somewhere far away just in case? I've thought so much about it, it scares me sometimes. Other times, I see it as a goal, which is refreshing since I can't remember the last time I thought I could actually accomplish one. I don't know what to do.

I tried to slice my neck but the knife on my leatherman is a little dullTried to cut my neck after an event with my step mom because i was too busy writing my essay for college and didn't answer the door to my room. She said that i dont even live in this house and my room should belong to one of my other half siblings who are both under 6 and share a room with each other. After screaming to my face and stuff i didnt feel anything just my heart felt very heavy and with the amount of stress im having with college i just took my leather man and tried to slice my neck just out of curiosity if i could do it. Well turns out it was dull and now my neck is bleeding but not heavily and it stings. I stopped for 15 minutes to continue on my essay and thought i should give it another shot and tried to slice my other side of my neck. Nope its not sharp enough to cut through deep enough.

"It was proven to me once again that no one cares about me so now I’ve made up my mind about my fateI think I’m done. I can’t explain this to anyone though because there isn’t a soul on earth who cares about me. I’m just putting this here as my small cry out into the universe, that I was here, that I felt, that I suffered so so badly. 

My partner called the police on me last week because I was pretty dead set on killing myself and had locked myself in the bathroom. The police officer came and went, wrapped it up as quickly as possible, and didn’t help at all despite me telling him that I was definitely going to take my life. 

He did put me on “alert” which meant a crisis counselor was supposed to call and check in on me every day until I could see my therapist. They never called once and neither did my therapist or psychiatrist even though I was assured they would be contacted and told that I need help right away. 

My family is extremely unsupportive. I think I decided I would definitely end my life the night the officer was called and I tried to call my mom for some kind of support, and she just immediately started talking and talking and talking about herself, never once asked me about my life. My own family doesn’t know, and never will, the shit I’ve gone through because of my mental health. 

I loathe myself down to the core. I hate my life, and I hate how fucking irrelevant I’ve always been. There’s just something about me that makes people despise me on sight. I know for a fact that the mental health services are screwing me over like this because they want me to kill myself so I’ll be out of their hair. 

Before the year is over I’ll be dead. I’m going to do it far away from home. It’ll take months before anyone even notices I’m gone and by then they’ll probably have expected me to be dead and have gotten over it anyway. There’s a dam in my town that has a lethal drop. I’m gonna jump. I hate myself as much as everyone else does, so I’m gonna take out the trash.

I can’t even begin to imagine how she was feeling, and what took her to that point. My family and I are always going to blame ourselves for the fact we didn’t do better. 

I’ve been that low, and I know how she alone she must have felt. It breaks my heart. So many of us loved her.

In her honour, I want to do everything I can to ensure this doesn’t happen. That anyone in an abusive relationship is not made to feel like nobody else will love them, or that there is nobody they can talk to. I knew she needed help and I always meant to try and push her towards therapy and I didn’t. I could have done more and I know that.

I know she wasn’t thinking rationally before she did this. But if you are in this same dark place, please know I am here for you. I will talk you through it. Nobody deserves to feel the way she did. I know the ‘just reach out’ idea isn’t always useful, but I’ve learnt some steps that have helped me when nobody else is awake and I feel alone.

"How do I stop overthinking Whenever I think about trying to be more social and talk to more people, I think of a lot of stuff. A big thing is that people just don't like me and don't want to talk to me so I find it hard to try to talk to other people myself. People didn't talk to me much and I didn't talk to a lot of people either, so it's hard to justify any reason why I should even try since nobody likes me anyways. 

Another thing is just how weird it is to talk to someone I don't know for no reason other than to try to make some friends. The more I think about it the weirder the idea gets and the worse I feel the outcome would be. This ties into the first thing a good bit as well.

And girls. I don't fucking understand how to talk to them without accidentally flirting or anything. If I tried to flirt with a girl I'd probably end up with a restraining order (not literally, but she probably wouldn't take it as a compliment coming from me), or even if I didn't try to flirt but did something that could be interpreted as such. I already have enough social anxiety and I don't need it to be worse for girls.

I'm also 18 and feel like the biggest fucking loser because I still don't know how to do all this shit. Like for fucks sake I'm too old to not know how to talk to girls or anything, so it feels too late to even try to fix anything. 

But if I were to try anyways, how? Anytime I'm in a social situation with people I don't know all I can think about is how as soon as I start making an effort to talk to people that it'll all turn against me and everyone will hate me.

"My mind is deteriorating.I’m 17. Sometimes I don’t believe that myself. I turn 18 in a little more than a month. It will be a year since my my psyche was shattered. I tripped on my 17th birthday. 

Prior to the trip and all of my life I have been extremely observant and analytical since I’ve had real consciousness. Before it was only thoughts that past by me, thoughts that held no weight with me. I could allow them to go and my only real problems were the typical depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and miscellaneous other symptoms of a few things. That started around 12 for me so I was very used to existing like that.

Things started getting worse before my trip, the thoughts gained weight and some didn’t leave. I heavily started questioning my existence. One of which was the simulation philosophy. So much so that I forced myself to stay awake for days to see if I could “compromise the simulations integrity.” What actually happened was I passed out in class from exhaustion and woke up to my dad telling me to get up and come to the car. Although now the philosophy doesn’t bind me quite so much anymore, it shows you the state I was in before tripping. If you don’t know, psychedelics and the experience you have are heavily correlated with your mindset. This was not a good mindset clearly, but I neglected that for whatever reason. 

I had an ego death. I was completely broken. I was in and out of reality, present in my body but shifting in and out of the real world and elsewhere. Almost like a void, like I was being teleported to a place with all of the secrets of the universe and this place was forcing all of them into me all at once. Completely broken, I was quite literally in the lap of one of my close friends gargling incoherently and crying. Nothing made sense anymore, even more so than before. The night ended after I made myself vomit, then couldn’t stop vomiting. All I wanted was to fall asleep and make it all stop. I didn’t sleep for a full day after that. I couldn’t. I changed my lockscreen to a somber solid yellow and my home screen to a baby blue. 

The following week I wouldn’t leave my room. My girlfriend at the time had no clue what to do. I was so traumatized I absolutely wouldn’t leave my room. She somehow convinced me to go get food with her. The entire way their my brain was going fucking haywire. Tearing everything apart. I believe at that time my object permanence truly started fleeting because I for the life of me could not comprehend any existence beyond the bounds of my vision. To clarify, any room I sat in was the only room in existence. Noises outside the bounds of its walls were only attempts by my mind to create depth to the reality I reside in. We get to the restaurant and I am having a full blown internalized panic attack (how all of my panic attacks happen.) She got her food and we sat down. She’s talking, I know she is because I see her mouth out of my peripheral vision. I am not looking at her. I’m looking at everything else. The people walking around, the chairs, walls, floors, the curtains, doorways, my hands especially them. All the while my internal monologue is screaming things to convince me I don’t exist. I couldn’t handle it. I got up and just left. I just walked out. No warning. She didn’t even question it, part of me knows she expected that outcome. That was no where near my rock bottom but I’ll just allow that to give you a sense of my progressively worsening state.

For nearly the past year I’ve been tormented by my thoughts. I currently have no object permanence, my senses don’t translate to my consciousness, I have a profound solipsistic mindset. I’m alone inside myself. The creator of my own universe is myself and it is the loneliest scariest form of existence and oh so ironic that I’m pouring this out to people I don’t even believe exist. What else can I do. I’ve had a psychiatrist for the past 8 months and I’ve been working so hard to bring myself back up. I lost all of my ability to socialize after that day and now I am so aware of the things I say it’s mind numbing. That in and of itself causes me so much anxiety because I constantly feel the need to hold up conversation with people I fucking hate because they all feel so empty. Everything is empty.

For a longtime afterward I was afraid of dying. Absolutely horrified of facing that void again. Now I am so so tired of the torture that is my existence. I live in constant fear that I may come unhinges and my psychosis will take over. I will lose myself in the murky depths of my brain.  I would rather consume myself by my own choice than wait for the day it consumes me. I self harmed today I cut all over my arms and I wish I hadn’t stopped because fuck it felt so good. To feel something again felt so good.

It’s to the point where I’ve tried doing drugs and drinking to do anything but it just makes me feel either flat or like I’m sinking. During the past school year my school has been threatened to be shot up and bombed (separate occasions) but it didn’t bother me. No risk even occurred to me even when I tried. Nobody ever talks to me and the last time I really felt anything was when a good friend was moving and their last word about me was “you know, you’re too sad all the time.” Now I sneak out when I can’t sleep which isn’t often cause I usually sleep close to 14 hours a day. I spend most of my money on drugs just cause it might bring me something to experience. 

I have rope in my closet if I ever want to leave and honestly I’m not sure why I haven’t already. There’s nowhere to go. Not down or up. I don’t cry no matter how much I try and I can’t get anyone’s attention to possibly just give me a hug or maybe I’m just that unbearable. I’m not scared that I’m not liked and even hated by some people and in fact I’m extremely passive about it. I wish I could just be worth a dime to someone. Even that statement is part of the problem. I become physically sick and disgusted with myself whenever I get physically or emotionally invested with people one on one. It frustrates me but not even emotionally, just mentally. Fucking Christ I just want to drag a razor across my face. I want to rip myself open and tear the meat right off my hands with my teeth. Someone has to die here and I think it’s gonna be me.

"I am very severely selective mute, I can speak to strangers, but not my own family. I don't know what to do anymore. [m/16]I am 16 and as a result of not receiving full attention as my Dad had to be looked after for the first 7 years of my life (Motor Neurone Disease)/not having a father figure etc, I developed a very bad selective mutism, where I cannot speak to my own family properly, and I can only do basic words and phrases, going beyond makes me feel like hell all over my body.


I live in the UK, so the doctors wont do anything and the mental health treatment is pretty much non existent, I haven't even been diagnosed because they don't care at all.

**but it gets worse**

My brother and sister never attempt to talk to me, I am an outcast, and I am pretty sure that they actually believe that I have severe autism or am retarded in some way, this is because they have never seen me speak to my own friends and strangers in a normal way (and it would kill me inside if they do, thats how SM works).

My mum cares about me, but doesn't realise the full extent, she has recently tried to help me by 'talking to me more like an adult', thanks.. I guess.. I mean I am 16 so it's about time. It doesn't help at all though, she doesn't understand my situation.

Before anybody suggests, no I **cannot write notes to them, it is a full on block on communication**.

This is probably my tenth or so cry for help on reddit, I am losing hope, I must keep going but I am losing hope. Can you imagine being silent inside your own house, being scared to talk around your OWN family, for 16 years and counting!? Just imagine, not being able to have a conversation with any of your family members, it's essentially like being an orphan, but worse in my opinion. Why? 

I cannot have friends over. They cannot be in the same house as me or any of my family, as the thought of my family hearing me talk normally kills me and I cannot do it in front of them.

One time my mum insisted I have a friend round for a weekend, so I did. It was quite horrible, sure it was fun when I locked the door and played games in the attic with him, but when I went down to eat at the table with me him and my mum, I sat in complete silence. Complete. Silence. And he was probably wondering what the fuck was going on, nope just completely normal for me.


**I need help**. But I don't know what to do. I really do not know what to do anymore. I am 16 and I am running out of time. I don't even know if this is curable, I don't even know if it is too late for me, for all I know it could be, I could live a life without talking to my own family, and to me, that is the worst thing that could happen, and I'm not sure if I could live with that. 


I don't know how to go on, SM has been the cause of my depression, and it is the one thing that is holding me back from curing my depression (I can't not be depressed and have selective mutism at the same time, it is not possible for me).


Please help me, in any way you can, I am broken.",,Depressed

"I feel like I've tried everything to try to keep myself afloatHi. 26 year old male here. Depressed since high school, severely depressed since beginning of college. I still think about suicide on most days. The problem with telling myself that things will get better is that I always turn out to be wrong. Things might get better moment to moment, but not in any general way, which is the way that truly counts.    

I always find myself asking, 'Why didn't I just kill myself last year?'...or last month, or 5 years ago. 

Nothing has made me want to live since. I've always felt an impending doom about my future... i.e. insecurities. They say that's what depression gets you to unreasonably think. But sure enough, I am currently experiencing that doom in a gradually more intense way (over the years), just as I always feared. What happened to everyone telling me life gets better? All I've learned is that I was right. I hate sporadic periods of hope because they only end up disappointing me. Hope is a curse for me because it convinces me to stick around longer. 

I've tried therapy, meds, talking with friends, gym, sports. It's like I build a tolerance to all of them and they simply have no effect anymore. I don't know what else I can do.   ",,Depressed

But after posting and talking to a few people I realized that I was willing to give life another shot. So I tried my hardest to live again and break out of depression, but things just got a lot worse.

It got so bad that I was actually ready to kill my self with a few methods I found online. I was even able to actually find some one online who was willing to sell me pills to help me kill my self as well. But before going through with any thing, I thought about you all who helped me and realized that I was battling depression the wrong way. Instead of trying to help my self I realized at the last minute that I needed help from other people. And while I'm not some one who enjoys other people helping me I realized it was my last shot at life.

So I wanted to thank you all because last week I finally told my parents about me being suicidal. I didn't have the hope or courage to tell them but I finally did because of you guys.

The only times people acknowledged was when I had panic attacks, cried, or was on the verge of suicide, and even at those times, barely. 

I have no one to talk to, no one I can trust, I hate talking about myself because it always makes me look like a troll or a beggar or overall a ''bad'' person. 

When I reach a certain condition, I deplete my bank account, and spending money gives me some sort of satisfaction, I don't earn much at all, and my disability prevents me from getting a normal job.

usually, my day starts off with my body forcing me awake, wanting me to eat, so shaky and all (while i believe this is partly caused by my limited food intake, it’s also a complication of a health condition i have). i’ll have something small, usually around 90 calories. that will serve for my breakfast, and i’ll head to school. i spend my lunch in the bathroom alone, having no one to sit with. if i work that day, so maybe every other day, i’ll eat a granola bar with around 100 calories from my backpack. when i get home from school, i eat a dinner of around maybe 350 calories, and that’s it. i’m young, and a girl, so i assume that’s enough to keep me out of starvation. that’s 440-540 calories a day, perhaps 540-640 if a friend offers me a snack or something, but i’m not thin - don’t worry. and by the way, almost all of my drinks are water or zero calorie monster energies so i don’t count those. 2 days ago i had a mango loco monster with 245 calories though - but that’s not the norm :). ughhh, i’m not fat, but i’m not even close to thin. i exercise as much as i can, too. daily walks with my dog and bikerides, and my work is a lot of heavy lifting. despite all my efforts to limit food intake (a lot of food grosses me out anyways) and exercise... nothing noticeable. i’m too scared to step on a scale, and i’d be uncomfortable sharing the number anyways, but just visually, i can’t notice... i’m so stressed. kill me.",,Anxious

"Is it weird or creepy that I like to organize all of my life's photos into specific folders? So to be more specific, I have OCD. And I had a bunch of photos on my computer from my whole life. They were just on there as they came from the camera, with no real titles or anything. Just numbers. And I let them be for a long time.

If you're interested, they're photos from when I was 5, to 19 today. For ages 4 and below, I only have a few paper photos.

But anyway...I was looking through them...and it was just such a disorganized mess, and hard to keep track of.

So I made 4 folders...one named ""Child Photos: Ages 5 to 9""...another named ""Pre-Teen Photos: Ages 10 to 12""...another named ""Early Teen Photos: Ages 13 to 15""...and last but not least, ""Late Teen Photos: Ages 16 to 19.""

This was so much easier for me, and helped get rid of a lot of the anxiety.

But then, one of my friends was like, ""you have zero posts on Instagram. Do you even take any photos of your life?""

I was like, ""Sure. I actually have very organized photos of my whole life, from ages 5 to 19, organized in specific folders, child photos, pre-teen photos, early teen photos, and late teen photos.""

And he was like, ""Dude that's actually creepy and weird as hell. I'd much rather you just have no photos of all than do that shit.""

And I was like, ""How is it weird? Seems normal to me.""

And he was like, ""It's weird because what the fuck are you trying to do? Make a fucking portfolio of your entire fucking life till you die?""

And I was honestly kind of hurt by this.

Even if it is weird or creepy though, I believe my reason of having OCD makes it justified.

You should’ve just done everything from the start. Look at your brothers, they have everything under control and have a great life ahead of them. You always get compared to them because they’re far more smarter, better looking, and overall superior than you. You shouldn’t have been born into the family, you were a mistake.

"Had problems with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts since 7 years ago; looking for advice/supportThis might be a bit of a long read, but I feel like I need to get a lot off my chest. Also, I apologize for any and all errors, but I'm not a native English-speaker.


So, my problems started around 7 years ago when I was a couple of years older than 10 (I am currently in my early 20s). I started having extreme anxiety about death/dying, which led to me having a lot of problems sleeping. Sometimes I would sleep maybe 2-3 hours a night for weeks at a time. It was also around this time I started to get a lot of anxiety in social situations, probably made even worse because I had so much trouble getting enough sleep. Even before I had all these problems I had always been a very shy and introverted child, but I was never unhappy or sad in the way that became the norm after I hit puberty.


Skip forward a few years, when I was around 16-17, and I was having periods when I could barely go to school because of my inability to sleep/the crippling anxiety I felt when thinking about meeting people. My last year of attending my country's equivalence to high school, I had around 30% absence from classes, time spent mostly lying in bed either sleeping or trying to suppress all my feelings. Even when I actually went to school, I spent most of my time like a zombie, barely aware of my surroundings. I still managed to graduate with decent grades, allowing me to get accepted this summer by the university I wanted to attend, but I recently had to leave because I couldn't handle the pressure combined with my anxiety. This summer was also the first time I opened up to someone, my parents, because I felt like I was close to my breaking point. Ever since I was 16 I've had suicidal thoughts almost daily, which got even worse recently. I've since been prescribed Sertraline and I've also started going to a therapist.


I feel I have made some progress, and I've generally felt a lot better since I started medication. But then today, when I was supposed to go to a New Year's Eve party, I just broke down. I felt this extreme, crippling anxiety about going out and meeting people, and I couldn't manage it. So I cancelled, and now I'm sitting here alone feeling miserable, sad and useless. All this progress I thought I made during these last few months feels like it was for nothing and all I want to do is cry.


So, I decided I'd finally post this because it feels like I'm nearing my limit. I don't really know what I want out of this post, but I know that if I go on like this I don't know what I'll do. All I want to do is disappear, because almost everything I feel is this anxiety, sadness and hopelessness that infects everything and drains all of my joy and energy. I just want some advice or support, something to make me feel better and get through this.

I'm thinking about telling someone in my family. I do not think they will take it well at all. I've been incredibly judged for my depression and anxiety problems in the past. When I try to tell people, I'm insulted and put down. I'm very much afraid telling someone will result in my whole family knowing, my being kicked out of where I live, and all of my prvacy being taken away from me.

Despite all this, I'm thinking of telling. I don't want to, because I am sickened at the thought of people making me stay alive. But, I feel vaguely bad at the idea of one of my family knowing I did this and blaming herself. This is not the same person I am considering telling.

"Simping can be stopped. So my friend was big into Charli dateline way back when she had a very small amount of followers and he's been watching her ever since. I never understood dancing videos, but he seemed to like her a lot. It got obsessive to the point of everyone pretty much knowing him as the ""simp"" of the group. This caused his mental life to not be to great. He would post them in chats and talk about it all the time. He would be very open about how cute he thought she was, until one day.
He told me he was buying something, something no one could have predicted. He was going to buy a custom body pillow with the print of her on it. Now let me say, he was pretty open about how he ""loved"" charli damelio (if you catch my drift). It was starting to get on my nerves. He cared so much about someone he had never met and he would be quite defensive if anyone insulted her. THE WORST PART is the fact that she is also a teenager. 
Now I can kinda understand having a body pillow of some random anime character, because they are cartoons, it REALLY doesn't matter there age. Its not defacing a real person. I can understand wanting to some p*rn you found online, but this, this was bad. Because I KNEW he wasn't just keeping that pillow just to look at (ew). I would pick on him pretty much everyday, and for good reason. A few days ago he finally stopped. He declared to everyone that he had stopped watching her, and that he was going to trash the pillow. No I know he could have been lying, but I chose to believe him. He said that he had already faded from watching her content, and he had gone back to regular p*rn. So that was good. He told me that an ACTUAL female girl he knew had gave him the realization he needed to stop, he had an actual crush. There's another reason, which I laughed at at first, but I mean, music can really help. ""Not afraid"" by eminem.
I asked if he could send a video so people would think that i'm not lying for internet points, he said no. :( BTW this story is not about me, I just want to incourage people that simping can be stopped and overcome.

When I was 12, I was diagnosed with OCD/depression and was put on medication. I maintained, and did really well in school. I ended up going to a good college, but was hit with a huge wave of depression and dropped out at the age of 21. I moved back in with my parents, and have basically laid in bed in the dark everyday for the past 6 years, occasionally turning to alcohol for relief. At the beginning of this year, I decided to put my life together and start building a future. I quit drinking, and was actively looking for jobs and possibly going back to school in the Fall. 

During the summer, I was contacted by the only man I've ever dated. We hadn't seen each other in 6 years. He was in town for business and asked if I wanted to meet up. We engaged in what I thought was safe sexual behavior as I am always cautious and protected, however two weeks later I got hit with an extreme illness that hasn't let up even until this day 5 months later. I immediately thought it was HIV because as a gay man I know the signs to look out for. I kept testing and testing and was negative all the way out to 4.5 months. Finally I went in for a final test at 5 months and was diagnosed. The man I thought I knew, disappeared and fell off the face of the planet. He has completely avoided me and won't own up to infecting me. I thought I was safe and did all the right things to protect myself, but I guess I was wrong. He was the first person I had been with in years. It feels unfair to be diagnosed just as I was starting to put my life back together. It feels like being kicked when you're already down. I feel like I've got cement blocks on my feet now. I feel stuck. I have no job, no skills, no resume, no friends, I live at home with my parents, I have no money, no health insurance. I have no way to pay for HIV treatment which means I will probably die a slow, painful death. I'm thinking about ending it before it gets to that point, because I'm already in a lot of physical pain because of this illness, which my doctor says is strange for a new infection. I'm devastated.

I was drunk and high at the time and I guess I got it in my head that if I used my uncle's rifle (the only one I have available) I'm sure he would feel the guilt of not locking it in a safe....i fucking know right?

So people have told me to smoke weed.  I got back into it just smoking by myself, but when i smoke just a LITTLE too much or if I'm with other people I get depressed and usually try to off myself.  Last time I smoked with someone I downed a bottle of adderall thinking it would stop my heart (I ended up walking Clearwater beach for about 13-14 hours instead...).  The time before that I cut my wrist open with a fucking buck knife.  I slit it 3 time and now I dont have feeling in my arm/huge goddamn gash for the world to see....I tell people I got burnt but I'm a horrible liar.  Anyways (Im babbling)  weed is just a no go for me, yet I wish I could smoke with people, have fun, make friends, think deep, and become the chillaxed lovable person I crave to be SO FUCKING BADLY.  The other night I thought ""fuck it, I'm with people I grew up with and I won't ever see them again after Sunday.""  So I smoked, not alot but enough.  All I can remember was how they avoided me when  I would geek out, (but thats not what I'm worried about).  I decided to go to sleep early to avoid annoying them.  I just remember laying there thinking way too hard, I thought my brain was going to implode.  I started crying like a bitch and punching myself in the face as hard as I could (thank god everyone else went upstairs).  It was more horiffic than last Thursday when I thought I was either in hell or purgatory.
Death seems so peaceful, even if there is a god and I do go to hell...I can adapt to that and its seems like a place I would be more welcome in.  I really just don't want to try anymore.  I'm going home, but to what?  I can't ask for my old job back,  I loved my employees but outside of work they wanted nothing to do with me.  My only friends have gone down paths I should know better than to join.  My brothers friends think I'm psychotic, makes sense because I try to scare them whenever I get the chance, I don't really know why at this point, it just feels like instinct, and its kind of fun.

I'm sorry this is so long, I guess this is my last statement to the world since I dont plan staying here much longer.  (I'll stay on reddit though, at least until I pass out.)",,Depressed

to whom it may concern,

it has been brought to my attention that my mental illnesses are too heavy a burden for the people in my life to bear. i always thought i would make it through this, that i would live to prove wrong those who did not believe in me.

it seems that i am the one who was wrong.

life is not worth living if my illnesses will only push every meaningful person away. i have been so strong and survived through so much, but i cannot handle another person abandoning me. i care so much about the people in my life, and to see them leave, only to come back and then leave again, is far too much to handle. i cannot take it any longer. i am tired of living in pain.

a written will won't be necessary, as i have nothing left to give.

i'd like to thank:

s.b. -- for being my best friend, always being there for me, and never failing to make me laugh, even though all i wanted to do was cry.
g.j. -- for sticking by my side throughout the years, even though i haven't been able to see you in person since you moved to south carolina.
l.c. -- for caring about me for so many years, and doing anything you could to help me. please thank your mother, father, and sister for me.
s.g. -- for taking me in after i was hospitalized the second time. you made me feel like i had someone when i felt as though i had no one.
s.d. -- for always being so incredibly kind to me, even though we haven't talked in forever.
j.z. -- for standing up for me no matter what, regardless of whether or not we were friends at the time. for that, i am eternally grateful.
s.g. -- for spending time with me when i was feeling extremely lonely, and giving me a shoulder to cry on.

i'd also like to thank l, k, and s, three of my internet friends, for supporting me from thousands of miles away.

some other people i'd like to thank, possibly the most important ones, are my mother (r.w.), grandmother (a.p.), father (r.w.), and sister (j.w.) along with my uncle (r.w.) and aunt (p.w.). thank you for never giving up on me, even though i have given up on myself.

i'd like to give a special thanks to the friends i made in psych hospitals, partials, and intensive outpatient programs. particularly j, t, k, m, m, a, a, e, and h.

finally, i'd like to thank a few people who are no longer in my life but were extremely supportive for the short time that they were:

e.m.
n.b.
s.h.
m.m.
m.r.
g.h.
e.v.
p.d.

you all have a very special place in my heart. i am so sorry if this brings you any pain, but i have decided that it is time for me to be selfish for once. people who are suicidal are selfless every single day just by continuing to live for those they love. after doing so for many years, it is my turn to be selfish, and end my suffering, even if it causes others to suffer.

all i ask of everyone is that you do not blame yourselves, and that you do not let my decision to end my life cause you to end yours. 

i love you all and i am so unbelievably sorry. 

yours,
k.r.w.

may god forgive me",,Depressed

I know it’s probably stupid but I can’t help but worry I may have pushed for the idea a little too hard, I was pushing it because idk if we’ll end up sharing a class plus I figured it would be a good way to make some friends but I worry she may have misinterpreted it as me trying to get her to go on a date or something.

"Borderline Ex vs ADD me = suicidal thoughtsI can’t get over the fact that I was betrayed, lied to, manipulated, left in such a cruel way and to make the whole formula even more harmful even sued by my borderline ex gf.

I’m trying. I’m trying daily. But gym, work, the girl that’s so deeply interested and in love with me at the moment, my friends, my nice body, my beautiful car.

Nothing helps me to escape my deep anxiety. The feeling that leaves me crippled every minute where I’m by myself.

I’m done because the fact that access to psychological help is so hard here. I’m confident that seeking help while stating I’m suicidal will in my current situation lead to losing my job and existence.

I have voices in my head sometimes that make me say loudly and clearly while I’m alone “I want to die” that force me sometimes to think about dying.

"Questions about texting from an overthinker Might delete this post and might not reply to comments but just want to see if any of my general overthinking-isms are valid and want some validation for the logical side of my mind that says I'm overthinking. Here they are as follows:

Does it come off as needy to start too many text conversations? I've been texting with this girl nearly every day during school and the weekends but our convos almost always start with something school-related and spiral into multiple hours long back and forth. Over winter break there is obviously nothing school-related to talk about so I've only come up with an exigence to start a convo once so far in what has been a 4 day-break. Despite that conversation going from Saturday morning into late in the night, do I come off as too needy of a friend if I were to start another convo too soon, should I wait a few more days before trying to come up with something to talk about? For some other info I'm pretty sure she texts with a decent few other people (maybe only a few and not a decent few, am not entirely sure) as well and I don't text with too many others.

Also, is it a good or bad thing that she's said she tends to be kept up at night dwelling on things that she's said that she thought were awkward to other people (probably more figuratively being kept up at night but she still thinks about them) but that I don't seem to judgy so she doesn't really get any sort of anxiety or whatever from saying things she thinks are awkward around me?

Also, I think she texts maybe a few other guys, am not sure how many or how frequently though if that adds anything more to the equation.

&amp;#x200B;

That was a lot of words and I think I may have slightly answered some of my questions in the fact that I was able to write so much about all of those questions but would appreciate some validation from internet strangers that I am in fact overthinking. Thanks in advance!",,Anxious
"I just can't take another moment of this anymore. Getting everything off my chest!!!!**First and foremost forgive any grammar issues, I just typed this all up and been crying ever since.**

Hello Reddit, please be kind and gentle and don't judge me. I need to vent, there is no TL;DR, so please stay with me. I am 440lbs US measurements, I am 5'11"" and my BMI is 62. I have been obese since I was 5 years old, I found out I have very low thyroid, a non existent metabolism and my Dr said because my mom was over 600 lbs before and after me, plus my dad being obese and one of his sisters being over 700 lbs, genetics also play a role. I have PTSD, Severe social anxiety, Agoraphobia, OCD, ADHD, and I am working hard on trying to take care of this all.  I am on SSI/SSD I get $755 a month for my mental issues.

Now after the short introduction, here is my life story... 

i was hated by everyone in my family i never knew my dads side of my family till i was 23 so from 5 to 17 i had a step dad he raped and molested me daily age 5 to 8, once by an uncle at 7 from 7 to 11 by my cousin jennifer i was beaten daily till bleeding or my step dad got tired of hitting me from 5 to 17, no one believed me i was always a liar. everyone hated my real dad because he was a poor man who worked his ass off, my mom had a sister named jean, jean had a daughter teressa and teressa had 3 kids, john, julie and jennifer, jennifer and i were the same ages. my mom had an adopted daughter named debbie, debbie was mentally slow, she had a daughter named stacye who was a few years younger then me.
 
while i was being beaten raped molested punished daily for nothing, i was molesting stacye, because its all i knew. my moms sister jean would constantly call me a liar hit me slap me, when my birthday came around she got me nothing when johns, julies or jens came around she got them over a 100 gifts
 
my mom always told me i was a mistake from age 7 and up. told me she just wanted to be pregnant give birth thats it. she didnt care what her second husband didas long as she had someone. at 18 i caught my step dad and my moms uncle in bed, i told everyone at dinner that night. he threw hot coffee in my face i went pitch black, i saw nothing next thing i knew i was in jail, the story is he threw hot coffee in my face i grabbed a knife and went to stab him
 
my mom said glen jeans husband got between us and stopped me. i was on probation for 6 months and had a 3000 dollar fine. while on probation i had to call in everyday my step dad hid the phone from me so i wouldnt be able to call in so i had to walk 15 miles to a pay phone and 15 miles back every day. after probation i ran away was homeless. living on the streets eating out of dumpsters trash cans, walking 60 miles for 8 days had blisters the size of baseballs on my heels of my feet. 

i was even having to drink my own urine at times just to have something to drink. i would bounce from julies place to johns house to jenn and treassas place. they would let me stay a week after i paid some bills in exchange for staying there they would kick me out. this went on for years. at 23 i found my real dad he was sick, of liver failure i watched him die in my arms. his sister who im renting a room from  now wouldnt let me stay at the time with her.

so i was homeless again, i grew up watching my mom trying to kill herself. she would spend days in hospitals in icu and stuff, so from age 8 on up her trying to kill herself was no big deal. i tried kiling myself when i was 9 yrs old by drinking bleach, so suicide was no big thing in my family even my cousins was trying off and on
 
finally when i was 25 i called to check on my mom 4 days go by nothing from her i send the polkice to her place, they go in tell me shes dead. left a note saying she cant take being single and alone anymore. fyi, my step dad left my mom for her uncle after i left home and became homeless. 
 
when i was 18, i was talking to this homeless guy and he said he couldnt take being homeless anymore the real struggles that go with it. he pulled a gun out shot himself right next to me, then i witnessed another homeless guy over dose, a week after that. when i was 24 staying with jennifer and treassa jenn killed herself by cutting her wrist she bled out in my arms while we waited for the police.
 
while i was homeless i was walking the streets one night down a highway it was empty except i seen this car on fire with kids screaming bloody murder begging god to help them, they were burning alive i couldn't get anywhere near the car, i walked as fast as i could 2 miles the opposite way ie the way i just came to get to a payphone to call 911, by the time the fire dept showed up there was 3 dead people in the car the person in the front and the two kids
 
at 29 i moved in with my aunt my dads sister, paying her 300 a month in rent, i tried from 29 to 34 to get my GED i was walking 6 miles a day 5 days a week to study for my GED. i failed the test every time i took it for 4 years
 
i been trying to save for a car the past few years but things come up. where i have to use my savings to buy food or meds or something else, i bought a car 8 months ago got scammed out of 2 thousand dollars the car turned out to be a clunker had a busted engine, the dealer hid from me. so i was out 2000 and trying to save again as of now i have 300 saved. i get 755 a month, trying to save for a car. 

past 7 years of trying to date, I have been told I don't deserve a relationship, I am trash, I am ugly, no woman would ever want me, I am nothing, I could never pleasure a woman, Told I need to end my life. Or I have been catfished, lead on like they wanted me then would fake their death on me after leading me on for months, or call me having sex with someone, or they would disappear then show up months later stalking and harassing me. I mostly get rejected over my weight and treated like I am not a human. As if I have no feelings and I don't matter. 

I am just exhausted from it all and tired of being alone and having no support but myself, I am tired of not having anyone there to have my back or love me or just to cuddle me and tell me it will be okay. I have no one to give me a reason or purpose to keep fighting or keep going. I have no one. I am just so tired of going to bed worried if this is it and I may die in my sleep and won't wake up tomorrow and will never be able to have had a chance at a real relationship and real love, then when I do wake up, I end up waking up crying because no one is next to me, and at the end of the day, I keep pulling through and making it through the day for what, just for me to be alone, by myself.

I'm too cowardly to go through with it, so I should probably get help with that.. to actually go through with it..

The idea of them growing up between 2 houses, going back and forth every week/weekend, seeing their mom getting a BF and their dad getting a GF, not being able to be there to see their milestones is killing me. I am thinking that maybe with one parent out of the picture might be easiest for them. Instead of blaming both of us for the absence of a proper family around house I wouldn’t mind taking the blame for being the “weak link” in the family who took the easy way out. 

It is easier for the moms to make such a decision as the court system tends to side with the mom when it comes to custody and don’t get me wrong I am all about the best environment for the children no matter what.

"Thinking about committing suicide ? Perhaps you've already done itAn interesting idea crossed my mind every time I was contemplating the decision of switching from life to death: **IT JUST MIGHT BE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY DONE IT.** 

I am not debating your belief here, I am not even religious, but I do believe that life is a twisted game, that our spirits and  our existence is transcendental, that we live through more lives, one way or the other. 

So I've been thinking about how many suicidal people think that ""I just want to end this life because it's horrible....if I'd just have another life everything would be fine, but I have THIS one and THIS one is unbearable !!"" - now the true mindfucking thing is that perhaps THIS IS ""the other"" life - have you considered it ? Have you considered that perhaps you committed suicide in a previous life and you thought that ""YES, THIS NEW LIFE IS GOING TO SET ME FREE"" and now you're living exactly that life and you're suicidal again ?",,Depressed

While I’ve been here I’ve had to watch her spiral into these crazy conspiracy theories and listen to her rant about how Democrats are the problem in America and that all of these recent events have just been a set up. I’m a democrat, and it hurt hearing my mom say this. She’s also told me on multiple occasions that she’s suicidal and wants to drive into a tree or jump out the window. My stepdad refuses to listen to her and she refuses to get help. He doesn’t want to help raise my almost 2 year old half sister, leaving my mom to do almost all of it while he works on his car. So I’ve felt as if it’s my responsibility to keep her mentally healthy. She still freaks out randomly and every time she does I get filled with a deep fear she’ll snap and kill her self. With all these things happening recently I’ve begun to lose hope in having a happy future. I feel out of place at my dads house and my moms house, I can’t move out anytime soon. I can’t tell my mom I’m suicidal because she’ll take it personally and it’ll make her feel worse. Maybe I’m just not meant to make it, survival of the fittest  and I’m not fit.",,Depressed

"Got over my crush and It feels great. So i will add context  for this because is necessary, and sorry for it being long, and i am not native speaker so it will have many grammatical mistakes.

So my family and i moved to the USA from Mexico due to my father work, temporally. After passing to 9th grade this is where stuff begins. In the fall i started hanging out with a group of people in gym class, the thing in that class you mostly chilled out and hangout with your friends, often letting us just sit down and do our own stuff. Out of the group of friends (Let's call them ""M"" not associated with anything just felt like it) i started to grow some sort of affection or just platonic care for ""M"". ""M"" is an interesting, reliable, smart ,  and just a cool person to talk overall. The school year went out and after the winter break, and enjoying highschool i just developed a crush for ""M"". Suddenly covid enters the chat and the school quarantines, and we kept talking (At this point ""M"" had shown some interest on me). Well we start talking and share many experiences, and talking the usual stuff friends talk about. Then one day ""M"" said that they liked me like that, and we kept talking, this would have been fine if ""M"" didn't told me later that ""M"" was still in a relationship with their partner, (I knew ""M"" was in a relationship but when ""M"" started talking like that, i didn't think it was appropriate of me to ask her about her romantic life, and i assumed why would they talk to me if ""M"" was in a relationship, so i thought maybe they just split), and ""M"" wanted to continue on their relationship which is fair, so ""M"" stopped talking in a romantic tone. At this point I started growing some anxious stuff in my mind due to those experiences, and thinking that the only reason they started talking me like that is because (More context, my family signed a 2 year contract but then got another year, and at the time we started talking i thought we were going back during summer) they knew about that and just wanted to have fun with no consequences after and they were just being bored, not saying this is what they thought but what i felt, i grew to hate myself due to being a part on something like that, and the fact that this was the first time i ever felt something like that towards someone, and let me tell you it did not felt good nor fun. After sorting out some things i still talked to ""M"" as a friend, and told her after some time how i felt bad towards his partner for being part of that, and ""M"" explained other stuff about that, and we sort it out, ( I still felt horrible but  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  ). After this the new school year started in online classes, and we still talked normally, yet I felt like ""M"" started to answer less or just felt they just answered shortly or just quick answers, and I assumed it was due to getting focused on school which i know it was really important and I recommend to y'all to focus in school, but i still felt like it was leading to a dead relationship, so one day I just told them I didn't wanted to keep this friendship and just wished them the best of lucks, and ended the friendship. ""M"" said that they didn't have harsh feelings towards me and we remained in good terms. After that 2 months of just doing nothing special outside of normal online classes, and one day i decided to for some reason, talk to them back for a reason i don't even know to this day, ""M"" responded and we kept talking about miscellaneous stuff, and the weeks pass and ""M"" asks if i still like them like that, which I answered ""Yes"" and ""M"" said they also think they like me like that. The thing is I don't know if ""M"" wanted to be in a romantic relationship due to school or other stuff, so I tell their sister which i had became friends months ago and told her how i feel, and she just told me ""M"" is not looking a relationship due to personal matters. So after that i felt  relieved about that and even though I still like ""M"" i don't think it will be just healthy to still have a crush on ""M"" because it can't happen.

"Just found out the mother of my two kids cheated on meSo, lately I've been in a place in my life where i thought things were improving. My S.O. had ended up in a place where she most likely will get hired. I've been completing my studie and have had a goal to look forward to and that i seem to be reaching.

Our relationship felt stable, it felt like our future was really damn good. But, yesterday she acted very strange when i went into the bathroom where she was, i knew that look in her eyes of surprise and hiding something. I didn't do anythign about it at that point because i thought that maybe i was imagining things.

Today i decided to just have a quick look in her mail because of that funny feeling i had. And there it was, a mail that she most likely had forgotten to delete. It was blank but contained a video clip, a clip where she was masturbating sent to some mail. I looked who she had sent it to, it was a guy that i knew about, whom she has talked to before, someone that she claim she was only friend with.

I have been in a relatively stable position in my life, having suffered from depresseion since 12 years back. And this hit me like a massive boulder. My kids are 1 and 2 and they're the highlight of my life but i have no idea if i am able to stay strong through this and be who i want to be to them.

I have no idea how to proceed from this, I have attempted suicide in the past but i know that suicide most likely would be devestating to my kids and extremely unfair.

How the hell does one proceed from this?

Theyve begun to check the wifi because of my lil bros watching youtube, and they want to keep catching them out. They dont know if i watch youtube or not because i try to keep it on incognito, but the thing is, they wanna put a block on youtube. Not only will that affect my schoolwork bc we're given videos to watch, but they dont get how important youtube is to me.

"A Big Rant About Any Thoughts I had While Listening To the Halo 3:ODST Soundtrack I'm sitting here in my bed listening to the 10 hour version of the Halo 3:ODST soundtrack at 3:39AM when I have to wake up in less than 2 hours for school. God I'm so afraid all the time. I don't know what's going to happen after highschool and that scares me. I have 2 years of the only life I've known left, after that I know I want to enlist into the USMC but it's still so so terrifying. You know there's this quote thats been bothering me alot lately, it reads as: ""I didn't know we were making memories, we were just playing""- Whinnie The Pooh. I might've messed it up a little but you get the point. I used to love Whinnie The Pooh when I was younger. Why can't I remember that? Why cant I remember my little handmade plushie of him? Why cant I remember the last time my parents were laughing together? Why is the last memory of my mom before she fucking left us is her sitting my sister and I down with my dad telling us that they've decided to get a divorce? Why cant I remember anything before that, I'm trying so so hard right now and I just can't. Why am I crying right now? God I hate this, this fucking sucks. It's going to suck even more when I have to leave everything I thought mattered. I'm so scared, Im scared of what comes after highschool and Im scared what's after that because I'm scared of being forgotten after I die, I'm scared of the world not knowing my name. That's pretty selfish thinking about it. Why is everything after so scary and why am I so scared? Why am I asking more questions? Jesus our lives are kinda built up out of fear aren't they? I think that's kinda beautiful in a way though. Its difficult to put into words but I know its beautiful. 

I've been talking to this girl lately, I told her how I feel and she said that she said that if its going somewhere she needs me to be a little more open with my emotions. I told her that's something I could do. Is this a subconscious attempt at being more emotional. Wait she didn't ask me to be more emotional, she asked me to be more open about them. So why the hell am I here crying at 3:56AM? Maybe I needed it. Maybe someone else needed it. Maybe I just wanted to. I dont even know. God man but this girl is beautiful. She's funny, cute, smart, and she even has a lisp which I think is the cutest thing ever. But lately we haven't been having meaningful conversations I feel like. I've been super dry ever since I've told her how I feel. We also haven't hung our irl in person. But tonight she told me about a boy who she couldnt get her mind off of. Was it in a romantic way? And why do I care so much? I dont know, I don't think I should think about it. Besides I can always bring it up in person later.

I think this concludes my rant, thank you to anyone that read it. Just know I didnt do this for some bullshot like Karma that does absolutely nothing for me irl. Just know I think II did this ""for those who went into the cowling darkness and never came back"". Its okay to be emotional and talk about them.

"Dog President Below is my comedy featuring a dog that is for a grade. 

Dog president. You heard me right. Dog. President. President that is a dog. President with a color spectrum of just blue and yellow. He sees 17.6% of his own flag. He can't be racist if he can't see colors. He can't even say slurs, for he is a dog. The bestest boy in the Oval Office. 

President President (his legal last name) had a rough campaign to get where he is now. Dog President was a seasoned military veteran before presidency. He has served eight tours to Iraq, each one more dangerous than the last. Dog President has accumulated more than 4,000 kills. He received a medal of honor for his contributions to world peace. He was retroactively given sole responsibility for the death of Osama Bin Laden, for the Pentagon found it too embarrassing to release the killer of the most feared organization at the time to be a dog. It's worth noting that kill was purely out of duty to his country, not because Dog President is discriminatory to any races. Dog President even brought back a bone from that mission, though it is unclear where the bone came from. 

After his war efforts, he got right to volunteer work. Dog President spent most of his time collecting trash at his local dog park. When he noticed the public response to his selflessness, he decided to run for governor. Yes, he skipped mayor. His policies went toward nature conservation and a harsh stance on animal cruelty. The lucky mutt got in by a landslide. In the dog days of summer, he even participated in his volunteer work as he did before politics. 

With a last name of President, Dog aimed for the highest position there was. The campaign was smooth sailing until he publicly marked his territory at a debate. That scandal caused much uproar, but he soothed his supporters with promises of treats. On election day, Dog President is best remembered for winning voters over with big eyes, a wide smile, and a comforting demeanor. He was sworn in on a half-chewed copy of ""Peabody and Sherman.""",,Anxious

"Please help! I don't want to lose my closest friend.There are a million things to say about this man; he's very intelligent, funny, kind... he's been through dreadful times and come out stronger, but now I know it's all overwhelming him and after last night I know **I don't have long to help him**. I'm getting desperate here. 


I know I am the only person left who could significantly help him as I've had similar life experiences and have been suicidal for many years - although I've overcome it, so I truly understand it more than most. His family are very dysfunctional, with a dad who he barely knows and a mum who'd rather ignore the signs and buries herself in her own life. He's also successfully alienated himself from all of his previous friends, but I know what he's doing because *I did this to all my remaining friends!* I got to a point where I thought I was helping by removing myself from the world, and that the people who used to care wouldn't notice when I was gone, because I had successfully made them hate me.   

He has many reasons for feeling this way:

* Most importantly, his illness. Basically he has severe chronic joint pain which cannot be treated, and it's getting worse and worse. He tries to walk everyday just to keep himself moving. He doesn't like to show it but I can tell it's a struggle moving at all. He doesn't know when, but at some point he'll end up in a wheelchair. **He's only 19.** 

*  Secondly we both have similar views on life. We're both very science-based and so have a logical mindset. We used to have long, deep conversations about life and death, and agree that life is effectively pointless, and everything that we do or could ever do is meaningless (I won't go into this debate here). So he has little care for life in general.

* As I mentioned, he has a dysfunctional family. He's been seeing a therapist for a while but I don't know how much it truly helps.

* He's been smoking weed for years as it seems to relieve or mask some pain for him, however in the last year he's turned to more and more drugs. He's heavily addicted to methedrone (mcat, drone). He's also done a range from cocaine to ket to shrooms amongst others. The sort of friends he's gained from this aren't exactly too helpful either. I forced him to stop everything a few months ago...but now I don't know whether that's bad or good, seeing as he's gotten progressively worse. 

* He's had immense pressure his whole life to exceed expectations as he is very intelligent. Earlier this year he did have ambitions for medicine and was being pushed towards all the top uni's, but he realised this motivation just came from others telling him what to do. I asked him yesterday and his response was that he had no motivation to study anything; 'I live for nothing'.
  

The trouble is I'm currently at uni. This is draining all my energy trying to help when I need to be studying for exams. A few weeks ago he phoned me that he was just coming out of A&amp;E after attempted suicide. I've come back from uni recently and the first time I saw him was last night, and it was the most soul destroying experience. He wasn't there, it was as if he's an empty shell, utterly cold and lifeless. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Should I continue trying - and how do I even help him? Or is it kinder to let him take his life, knowing that he is in pain constantly. Reddit, I need your help.

TL;DR - I'm pouring my heart out over the closest person I've ever had in my life and I don't want to lose him. Go back and fucking read it.




**Edit -** Anyone who was following this story at all / interested to know what happened next, well I think things are going to improve from now :) 

I've been speaking to his mum and she agreed to put him in a specialist mental healthcare hospital near where he lives. He moved in last night and will stay there for at least 4 weeks, so hopefully something can be done! He's also on suicide watch, so that's a definite relief.

"It's all too muchI've been struggling with suicidal thoughts (suicidal OCD) for several years now, but with the world in flames and everything kind of collapsing and turning very dystopian very fast I am genuinely hopeless. I simply do not see a future. Cannot conceive of one.

I'm 45 years old and I've lived through mostly settled, calm times. The 80s were a sad but entertaining trip, the 90s were AMAZING, the 00s were depressing, and now the 2010s are ending with what seems like the end of the world. I can't stand it.

I can't stand living in fear every day. I'm just tired of it. I'm tired of bullies and sociopaths and sadists running our world. I just want to feel safe and okay for *once* in my damn life.

I'm a survivor of childhood abuse too; my life has been less than great. But now I feel like there's just no chance of ever making something good from the remnants of this life. I want to end it all. I'm tired of forcing myself to pretend like nothing's wrong just so I can get a paycheck. I'm tired of people acting like the world ISN'T on fire. I'm tired of pollyannas telling me everything's going to be okay when it very obviously isn't going to be okay.

I'm terrified of dying but my brain is constantly forcing me to think about killing myself against my will. My mind constantly runs me through methods and scenarios and is constantly telling me to end it all.

This isn't living. This isn't being alive. THis is a nightmare I can't wake up from, and the only way to end it is to overdose like I've been planning for a while. 

I'm going to call the suicide hotline AGAIN, just to see if they can miraculously provide me with some sort of reason why I shouldn't kill myself. It rarely does any good, but this is all that suicidal people can avail themselves of in the US now unless you have really good health care. 

If someone could help me get the hell out of the US and help me re-settle in some better country I would probably stop being suicidal. But right now it just feels like I'm a sitting duck, that nothing is going to get better, that fascism is already here and there's nothing we can do about it, and none of this is going to end well. I feel nothing but doom and death in the air and things weren't like this ten years ago.

"I've seen more porn addiction-related posts recently, and I want to help everyone conquer their addiction and stop watching porn altogether. **Intro**

Porn is a menace, now more than ever. Think about it, how quickly can you find porn starting now? Probably a minute or less. That's insane, and it's an awful problem. Teens, adults, and now even adolescents (!) are succumbing to a porn addiction. According to [psychcentral.com](https://psychcentral.com/blog/sex/2013/05/the-prevalence-of-porn), the average age a person first views porn is *eleven*. Eleven is young, super young. Eleven year olds should be playing with legos and watching DanTDM instead of watching porn and jerking off.

**What is porn?** 

Porn, or pornography is footage, images, or animation of sex. This includes irl porn, animated porn (hentai included), and heck even fortnite porn (yes that exists 👀.) Often, porn is studio produced, scripted, and very very fake. The guys are often pumped full of viagra and other drugs, and the girls are faking orgasm after orgasm as well as being 50% plastic 50% flesh.

**How do I know if I'm addicted?**
Porn addiction is pretty prevalent in todays society, with [5-8%](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/process-addiction/porn-addiction/related/pornography-statistics/) of adults being chronically addicted to pornography. This may not seem like a huge number, but keep in mind that porn is getting easier and easier to access. Also, aswell as the increased access to porn, my small, day by day usage was increasing into an addiction, which I have seen grow into an addiction.

**Yeah sure I use it, but what's so bad about porn?**
Porn usage (even once a day or less) can lead to several negative effects down the road should you continue using it. Negative effects such as PIED (porn-induced erectile dysfunction), which basically means your pp only gets hard with porn and nothing else, an unrealistic view of sex that objectifies women and sets the female beauty standard to big, fake breasts and skinny figures. Also, in hand with the failing sex education in America, many young kid's first view of sex is porn. Young boys grow up expecting their partners to do what the women in porn do. That leads to sexism and abusiveness and a slew of nasty stuff that men sometimes do to women.

**How can I stop?**
It's not easy to stop watching porn. Believe me, it's stupid difficult. You'll start making excuses like, ""well it's only once a day, what's the harm?"" or, ""I'll only take a peek, it's just this once."" But eventually you'll start realizing how dangerous porn is. You'll learn to jerk off without it, which actually feels way better since it lasts longer. Porn will start to disgust you, even when you're horny as hell. 
For me, r/pornfree helped my addiction alot. That may not work for some people, but they're a small and super supportive community that helped me reach 150 days pornfree. Another thing that helps is setting a counter for the amount of days that you're pornfree.

All in all, stopping porn is possible. It's hella difficult, and you might not believe what I'm saying. But, I hope that some of you try to nip porn in the butt, kick it in the balls and shove it off the empire state building.

"Rant About Everything That Has Gone Wrong in My Life Lmao \[This is gonna be me ranting so it's gonna be long\]I am at the point where all I want is to be happy and my parents do whatever they can to stop me from achieving that. I have ADHD but it's not super severe (The Attention Deficit part) I am medicated and it helps a lot. the only thing the meds don't help with is the inconsistent amount of dopamine my brain will produce sometimes. This really means that I will pretty much just get depression and anxiety for about 3-5 days at a time. It sucks, and I don't want to tell my parents because I don't want them to see me as being weak or babying me because of it. I tend to use the phrase ""I'm just not feeling it today"" when my parents ask me about it. The anxiety causes me to have a paranoid spiral where I'm completely convinced that all of my friends and mentors hate me. This of course isn't true but they are like intrusive thoughts x10. Luckily that has only happened to me a hand full of times. My mother hasn't been a very good mother, to say the least (My Dad and Mom haven't been together since I was like 5 and I live with my Dad and stepmom) and my stepmother is in no way a good maternal figure in my life because all she does is yell, scream, hit and demean me in any way possible. The lack of a mother figure in my life gave me what most call ""Mommy Issues"" People show me basic kindness and I instantly get attached to them, which makes it hard to know when girls are actually into me. But recently I was talking to this girl and we had a ton in common (The way we grew up, parental situation, our energies in general) and she was just a super caring person in general. I was gonna jump WAY out of my comfort zone and actually tell her I was into her (I have a major fear of rejection so I don't ask girls out) but she ""Got grounded"" and hasn't texted me in over a week. she was the only person I felt comfortable talking to about my problems (Was raised in an abusive household where I was never able to cry, let my feelings out, or tell people how I felt and to be masculine, some would call it toxic masculinity but IDK) and now she is ""Grounded"" (I keep saying ""Grounded"" in quotation marks because I have no clue if she just needed an excuse to ghost me or if she actually got grounded. she did talk about her parent doing that in the past but I had toxic friends who convinced me that if any girl showed interest in me they were fucking with me) and I feel like I can't talk to anyone. This girl would help me through issues and would give me positive affirmations whenever I would be feeling like I'm trash. Now I just feel kinda lost without her. we talked for hours every day and now all I do during the time is work out to try and forget the pain and lay in my bed. I would be going to the gym but my parents decide that I'm only allowed to leave the house when it's something they want to do or for school. I know people have it a lot harder than I do but to the people who don't have toxic parents or friends... you are lucky, you get to skip over the mental strain they put on you. convincing you that you mean nothing, that nobody could ever like you/love you/ be your friend other than them, it's all just shitty. I cut off my toxic friends and haven't talked to them in almost a year. I'm usually a very upbeat person but I just needed to get all of this garbage and bullshit out of my head.

The world just is a horrible place and don’t trust anyone anymore. I don’t ever want a relationship with someone ever again and I never want to learn about what true intimacy means.

I’ve been working on myself a lot with the school plans and apartment plans and it’s just financial stress, I can’t even smoke my electronic cigarette anymore because it’s too expensive for me. I can’t even eat food I like.
All I do is work and go to the ATM to take out money for therapy, doctors visits for medication, and more work. I barley sleep now and when I do I have nightmares, and I just am rushed around everywhere all the time. 

I can’t even do my job correctly anymore because I’m under so much stress and have so much pain that I forget what I’m doing at the job I’ve worked for 2 years. I keep misplacing my things and forgetting things.

I moved in with my grandparents last year and I guess finally having a stable home with parental like figures has made a world of difference for me! I'm even going off my Prozac soon! 

The one thing that keeps getting to me, is my loneliness in school. I am generally happy now, I have relatively small anxiety, but I can't figure out how to create fulfilling friendships with people at school! 
I feel like in my depressed stupor and with my family being too dysfunctional to have friends over all of all those years, I somehow ""missed"" how I'm suppose to maintain and keep friendly relationships! 
Now don't get me wrong, I have a bestfriend (she lives back in my hometown) and I have a boyfriend here but I feel like I cling on to these people way too much because they are my only ""real friends"".
While  at the same time I barely maintain ANY relationships at school or have a single friend group. I'm essentially a loner, because I suck at carrying relationships! 
I don't know what is 'cool' right now to talk to people about, and I hardly know anybody to even friendly gossip about!

I'm starting new classes and I met new people and I've been pushing my self to talk to people but it is so exhausting! I keep trying though because I don't want to fall into my old pattern of ""the less I talk to people the less I want to talk at all""

I'm nearing the end of my senior year and I need to figure out how to do this because I feel like this is one of the final things that are stunting my self growth and me getting out of depression once and for all!

"I want to dieTitle says it all. I wish I was dead and am so tempted to just jump in front of the next train that goes by our house. We can generally hear them coming so it shouldn't be too hard...

Basically, if I told you my story, everyone would just feel sorry for me. boohoo, poor me. Well, that doesn't really help me at all or change what I want to do to myself. Long story short, my older brother was messing with me for a couple years. I didn't want to but he practically forced me. When he left for college I told my mom about some of what he made me do and she slapped me in the face. Told me not to lie. She always liked him way more than me, so I am not surprised. 

That was like 5 years ago. Brother dropped out of college and joined military. Only came back home for major holidays sometimes. Now he's getting out of the army and coming back home for good and worse off he's coming back to live here. He's a fuckin adult, why is he coming back to live at home?

On top of it all, school was awful for me last year and summer break is turning out to be even more awful since I have no friends. Nobody loves me, and I mean that truly, nobody fuckin cares about me. 

Despite my life being a complete shithole since I could remember, I have only started wanting to die recently and I just so desire a release from this life. God made a mistake with me, hopefully he can try again and put me in a different life.

"How do I finally get friends? If you base the idea of me getting rejected by women not being on my looks, there are definitely a few reasons in the back of my mind I think I’ve been trying to avoid. 

1. I have lack of friends or lack of *good* friends. Real is subjective because for everyone real friends come and go.

2. I never could approach and feel the anxiety can be extremely painful. This naturally seeps into every area of my life. 

3. My past and how people have treated me sometimes catches up to my present regardless of whether I’m a changed man, feel like one, or even seem different to others thus making me even more paranoid and anxious. 

4. I was bullied and rejected from a lot of potential friendships in my school days. This has led me straight to a life of isolation and spending 95% of my days alone and I *know* this to be the main bout of my insecurities.

I also have made some good connections at work but sometimes I use that as a distraction and an excuse to make any real friends or connections.

I’m now 22 so not strictly so much a teenager anymore, but I guess I still feel like one in the way I behave act, but mostly react to people socially and my situation of feeling so rejection and carrying a lot of pain.

Does anyone have any solutions to this and has anyone ever escaped similar issues?

Also lastly I don’t want to manipulate anyone into thinking I just want friends so I can have a girlfriend. I just know this is one of the most serious situations I am lacking in my life that could turn my life on it’s head in a good way and open the door to serious relationships with women, as most after being told wouldn’t touch a guy with no friends or lack of friends with a ten foot pole. So with that in mind. Any ‘cure’ per say or reasonable advice would be appreciated. Realise I spent a lot of my life alone and rejected also.

I made another previous rant expressing how I felt like it was other people’s insecurity that someone prefers to spend a lot of their life alone rather than us particularly. But I know deep down that that is not the full truth and I want to fix it.

Sometimes the *pain* of my current reality ends up becoming more painful than defying my anxiety and doing what needs to be done in order to fix those situations. That’s why I’m ranting and venting so much on my profile letting go and trying to find all the self help I can. However some can be untrustworthy and immoral so it can be very difficult to feel like I’m escaping. Like I’m running but I’m just running on a treadmill.

"Rethinking all my Friendships D= My friend. MF=Mutual Friend. R=Random and Friends Cousin
Alright. So I started middle school this year so I’m in 6th grade. We weren’t in person for the first time until about a month ago. Over the year, I made a few friends In my classes but only one I actually spoke to out of school except for the girl I am talking to. He is in my home room but nothing else. It just so happened that he was mutual friends with my best friend from elementary school that I’m still tight with. Anyway, to get to the point, I found out his Xbox live and now him, our mutual friend and a few other people here and there, play 2K together. Tonight though was different. He added me to a face time call with one number I recognized as his cousin and two I had no clue about. So I join and my best friend isn’t there to back me up like normal because he was playing a rocket league wager. When I join the two ransoms are like “who is this kid D?” So D introduced me and they immediately started joking about my name and how I sound like a gay nerd bc of how I talk. I have a lisp and a small speech impediment that I’ve had from birth and I was in speech therapy and corrected most of it but it’s still sometimes there. Other than that my voice is pretty deep for my age. (Sorry for straying off topic so much btw, I just think these things might be important to the situation) So I half laugh, just so I don’t seem like an uptight crybaby. (Now for the rest of the story to make sense I have to lay a few more things out for context. All of the people except me on this call were biracial, me and my best friend are both white. I don’t want to get controversial so I’m just going to say me and my best friend both support the person who ran against Biden but please don’t criticize me for that, I don’t want to be political. I have a MAGA sign type thing in the angle I was holding my phone on ft. I make honor role and I helped D out with math a few times in the past. I’m slightly overweight but I’ve been working out)So the jokes continue about me being gay and at this point I haven’t even played a game yet. After the first one, D has also been “joking” about it. At this point I’m getting pissed and I tell them all to shut up. Then D says “Just because we are black and you’re white, and you’re good at math, doesn’t mean that your cracker ass can command us like slaves.” I was star struck. All that was going through my head was how I had been nothing but nice and he basically called me a racist pig that like to see black people enslaved. Then they start saying things like “yea you support trump and that makes you racist”. Eventually one of them who was a little more chill told them to chill out and stop giving me a hard time. Then the other random said “I don’t give a f*** he can burn”. They all died laughing. Then D says that I’m a fatass (I’m like less that 15 lbs overweight and I’ve worked off 20+ pounds in the past 3 months) and that I go around the school hallways handing out twinkies and whenever I eat one I think it’s spicy. Then the one I thought was kind of chill said “He prolly says’mmm this smacks, Lordy be’” he made himself sound like he was a redneck (I’m from Kentucky) and I don’t even know what he meant by the “Lordy Be”. We were just about done with the first game now and I had missed all my shots because I was so mad. They then called me ass and said I would never get a girl and that I was a racist jerk. I had shot a few jokes back at the start( that I now realize were corny) like when they called me gay I said “Yea you’re mom would say otherwise”. Anyway, they ended the whole thing with saying that if I were to die no one would miss me and I told them to fuck off, blocked all their numbers, reported them all on Xbox live for hate speech because that’s what I took it as and block them all on Xbox too. Now I’m fearing that more of my so called friends are like this and if I should just say screw it and never talk to any of them except the ones that I’ve known since kindergarten again. I’m sure I’m blowing the whole situation out of the water but what they said hurt and I couldn’t believe someone could change on me like that. Any advice?

""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""

It is quite possibly the most iconic quote in human history, and perfectly describes space exploration as a whole, in my opinion. However, did you know that we may have misheard Neil this whole time? Before his unfortunate passing in 2012, Armstrong insisted that he actually said ""That's one small step for A man"", not ""That's one small step for man"".

i also moved to another state and while that helped with my seasonal depression i know NOBODY except my parents and my coworkers. 

it’s been quite almost a year since the last time i tried to kill myself and i don’t wanna try again but i just wanna die. i would really apprentice it if a car hit me or i just didnt wake up.

At that point me, my brother, and my baby brother, (who is my stepdad's kid), are just trying to have fun which is kind of hard for me because I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I pick up a Nerf gun which my brother hasn't touched in months and just mess around with it. My brother sees me with it and grabs it away from me. I pick up the other one which is just sitting and my baby brother who is to picks up another one, (keep in mind we're just playing at this point), my brother once again starts trying to choke me and he grabs the gun again. At this point I think we're still ""playing"" so I give my 2 year old baby brother a plastic malet with rubber ends filled with air and just say, ""Go get those guns from him."" My stepdad then runs down from the     bathroom and starts screaming at me and tells me to go to my room. I do and then my mom screams for me to bring up the Xbox. I'd do that then five minutes later she storms down and I'm pretty sure she threw away my Oculus Quest which I paid most of the money for. While she came down for that she slapped me multiple times on the back of the head. She then goes back upstairs and storms back down and starts shaking me and and started saying she was going to have to get another divorce and saying it was all my fault. After that I seriously considered suicide, I had my knife and started pushing but I just couldn't go on with it.

"2 hours until I'm 20 and some words for this sub :,) Well, it's been a journey heh

Never thought I'd be 20 this soon honestly, it's been a ride.


I haven't been here much for the past 2 years ish since I slowly lost touch with the latest trends and memes here which I don't understand unfortunately.However,the 2 years before that has made an impact on me that I'm grateful for.I've enjoyed my time here, making memes,threads on topics to just have fun talking to y'all.I met some friends that to this day, I'm still talking to.I wouldn't be on Discord if I haven't met those very friends.


Some things I've learned along the way:


- The feeling of anxiety that people don't like you can be rough,or that you think you are annoying.Always remember that,if nothing has been said about that..then you are alright :)

- Life is short,make the best of it.There will always be ups and downs, don't let it get to you.Keep on moving and fighting, you'll be alright.I've helped people here in the past with depression in the 2 years and honestly all I can say is... whatever you are facing I hope things get better for you, don't go to suicide because of it,hang in there things will get better for you.I promise

- Be confident,it helps a lot.Mentally and Physically.


- Cherish your friends or Family,you never know when something is gonna happen.Be there for them.

- Love yourself,please do.Be grateful for the things you can accomplish so far.Take one step at a time when you're in tough situations, it's better than not taking a step at all :)

- Everyone is different and unique,remember that.You have your own traits and special talents, don't ever doubt yourself.You are special in your own very way.


I hope this all makes sense and will at least help you a little.
Thank you, r/teenagers for making my time here enjoyable and my college life tolerable as well.You have made such an impact for me that I'm always grateful for.

Ok so, when I got out of the bathroom, my companions looked at me. 

it was so embarrassing. 

I noticed that some girls felt guilty, but nobody told me anything. After class, I went home normally.

 The next day, however, I saw that a couple of girls had a ""last minute"" gift for me! I was so happy. They invited me to go to the park with all of them to open them together at the end of school. 

When we walked out, I found that they are not that bad, they looked nice! At the park we talked a lot, we had fun and even held a photography contest, where I was the judge. I think I found some friends!

"Finally hit rock bottom and no one is here to help me.I’ve thought about suicide for a few years but it’s always been a logical option for me. I never understood what people meant by not feeling safe until now really. I hit rock bottom a few days ago, the doctor sent me to the crisis team and for the first time ever I was honest that I go through flits of either wanting to kill my self or being scared that I’m going to ...

They sent me away with a number to call and a few diazepam pills. The doctor was nice but the nurse he was brash and having a go at me because he couldn’t understand me between my sobs and I couldn’t understand him through his brash Nigerian accent. 

Today I find myself in the forestry about ready for this all to be over, I have everything I need but the part of me that wants to make it reached out one last time and called that number, only to get the same guy tell me that I just need to deal with it basically. I tried to tell him I tried and cannot but he doesn’t give 2 shits and told me to call the doctors to get an emergency appointment for some zopiclone. So I try that and they have no appointments until tomorrow which I’m not sure I am gonna make.

"thanks for listening to mea few months ago, I started feeling suicidal. my life was falling apart and I couldn't do anything right. this went downhill for the next few months until now. you know the feeling when your whole body is aching? I would feel like that, except mentally, not physically. the mental pain was immense. that's the best I can do to describe how I feel. there would be so many negative emotions within me and I would constantly have an overwhelming feeling of wanting to die. 

if my emotions were illustrated by a bottle, the bottle be so filled on some days that it was going to burst and I would be on the point of almost breaking down. other days it wasn't so bad. but what really kept me going was someone that I could talk to. I never talked to my family about how I actually felt but this someone (my friend) listened to me. she listened. when I talked to her, I would be emptying out my bottle of emotions. it was not almost completely empty after talking but I would feel so much better. I think this was what kept me going and prevented a complete breakdown. 

to my friend, I don't think you'll ever see this but if you do (and know that it's you), I don't think you have any idea how grateful I am for you. if it weren't for you, I might not be alive and typing this right now.

I still struggle a lot with suicidal thoughts and I wish I could just kill myself painlessly. I know that I probably won't but I'll just continue to struggle massively internally. I'm hoping to get better with therapy but meanwhile holding on and talking about how I really feel to her.

"Trying to find a peaceful way to do it.Just look through my post/comment history.

I'm going insane.  I had my first court date for the criminal charges Patrick filed.  He was there.  He had the opportunity to call it all off.  To go to mediation at least.  ALL I WANT TO DO IS TALK IT OUT.  I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.  I FEEL LIKE SHIT PATRICK, I REALLY DO.

But no.  His lawyer told mine he ""has no intention of going to mediation at this time"".  He's being petty and vindictive.  And no one is caring about the abuse I suffered that led to all of this.  I can hear his voice in my head every day, telling me I'm worthless.  And I am.  I can't function.  I barely sleep anymore.  I'm back down to one meal a day, if that.  I haven't showered in 4 days.  

I'm being forced from my only home because I don't feel safe.  I just want to feel safe.  But that'll never happen.  He wants to ruin my life.  And he has.  But I just cant bring myself to do it.  I don't want to fail again.

Between my lost job, hospital bills, and therapy costs, I'm up to about $150,000 in lost money.  Luckily insurance is taking care of some of it, but I've been unemployed for 2 months now.  I'm moving into a new city for a new job, but nothing is going to help.  I just want the pain to end.  I want Patrick to realize what he's done.  But more importantly, I need him to understand that I didn't mean anything that I did.  Hell, I don't even have memories of it all.  The last year of my life is missing.  I have very few actual memories from that time.  And none of them cover anything that I did.  Of course, there are emails and other records that prove that I did it.  But I was not aware of my actions at the time.   Yet no one cares.  I just want it to be over....",,Depressed

"Too Cowardly To Kill Myself But Too Depressed To Keep LivingThis is not going to be an easy post for anyone to read or for me to write. To establish things immediately, no I am not considering s\*\*cide or am I in immediate danger. I would never do that to my mom, the one person in this world who truly knows me and cares about me.

With that said, I think I'm just done with life. It's been building for awhile and it just keeps building. It doesn't have much to do with the Coronavirus or the Riots but those have been the final straws. The Coronavirus has taken away my ability to even attempt to make new friends, try new activities or even do things I enjoyed like traveling and playing tennis. Luckily workouts have resumed in my state so I can do that. The riots have taken away my love for sports and history. It seems like everything I love slowly but surely is being taken away from me by various forces.

Even the activities I enjoy I don't enjoy as much as I used to. I feel like all they do is temporarily dull the mental and physical pain that I now feel constantly.

The Coronavirus has shown me just how hollow and empty my life has become. God is definitely not in my life and I am angry at him for various things (that I'll get into here in a minute). I am single and I have no kids or even pets to keep my company. While others at least had family to keep them company I've had no one. This Coronavirus pandemic has officially isolated me. Most of my family live in another state and I would be hesitant to travel for fear of getting them sick. Plus my nieces wouldn't see me anyway, they've bought into all the fear.

I have failed so often at dating it's become comical. I decided to get back into dating with stuff opening up. I went on a date on Tuesday that I thought was going well. We played mini golf but then, according to her, her perfume started messing with her allergies. We didn't have any food or drinks after the round as she felt like she needed to go home. I contact her Thursday where she tells me that she's been seeing another guy for awhile and that they have decided to be official and she wants to see where it goes. Needless to say I sent a nice little message to her, nothing rude but telling her I thought it was pretty low to have gone on a date with me knowing I had no chance. Like so many other times in my dating life I just felt used.

Besides being single with no kids or no pets I don't have a lot of friends. The few I do have know I struggle with depression at times and really do try to help. They all think I'm a very good guy who's just had bad luck and they truly believe I'm a good guy who deserves love and happiness. I just don't know if it's in my cards at this point.

Besides that my body failed on me pretty early. I'm 35 but my body started failing on me around 30. Always had high blood pressure that was hereditary. Now I'm slightly overweight, have hemorrhoids occasionally and also suffer from allergies and eosinophilic asthma. I was on a flight to Nashville back in 2017 (2 hour flight) where my throat really dried out. I started to panic which then caused my asthma to flare up. No medical emergency but it was a horrible flight. Now my doctor has me take a Xanax 0.25mg tablet before the flight to relax and a Prednisone 50mg tablet to control the Asthma. It's worked but whereas I used to love flying I now dread it. I feel like it's destroyed my ability to travel, I don't want to fly for longer than a few hours. But there's so many places I've wanted to see. I've asked my doctor about it and I've asked a Pulmonologist about it but they don't seem to take it seriously. I think they think it's all mental for me at this point. Ever since I became afraid to fly it's destroyed me a piece at a time.

So besides my body betraying me my mind has betrayed me as well. I know I've suffered from some Anxiety like I mentioned but even my therapist won't officially diagnose me with Depression. My mind is always half empty and I think my physical conditions have caused my mind to deteriorate.

All in all part of me truly wants to believe in reincarnation. That we get multiple chances at this life and that I'll just get another chance. I know Christian religions don't believe in reincarnation but it's one of the few things that gives me hope. I will say this, I think God made a mistake having me be born during this time. I believe I was born in the wrong time.

I have a job that's a good job but it's ultimately a dead end job. I've never been one who had that light click on in terms of a passion. I've always been adrift in terms of what I want to do. Yes I have a Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Management and Marketing. I also have my SHRM Certification as a Certified HR Professional. But if I'm honest I don't have a passion for any of it.

So my personal life is a mess. My physical health s\*cks, my mental health s\*cks. I don't have many friends and my dating life is an absolute failure. I feel like a lot of my passions are being taken away from me one by one. The Coronavirus is going to make it impossible to make new friends. The Riots have shown me that a lot of country hates me for my very existence. They hate me just for being a white conservative male.

I am a walking contradiction. I don't want to die and don't have to guts to but I've lost most of my will to live. I've wasted my youth, my best days are behind me and not in front of me and I no longer have any zest for life. Deep down pretty much nothing makes my happy anymore. Sure some activities dull the pain temporarily but I've lost the ability to feel happy. I've lost the ability to connect with people. I've lost any ability to have empathy or compassion. I just feel like I don't care anymore.

I don't know what I'm asking for out of this, I just had to finally get it out. I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could I really wish there was a ""do over"" button that we could press and start again. I wouldn't make all the mistakes I've made in my life. I would try to not be so da\*n introverted when I was younger which made it hard to make friends. I would've traveled the world before my health made my ability to travel by air an iffy proposition. I would've tried more activities to maybe find a passion.

I don't anymore guys. It just all feels so hopeless. If I had to use one emotion to describe myself at this very moment I think that's the one I would use. Hopeless.

"FUCK you Chloe 2 days after I had found out that my brother had died on January 6th, (2020) I was in school and this girl, Chloe, said that she liked me, and asked me out. I was feeling pretty bad then and that kind of brightened my day. 

The next day, on January 7th, I took a day off of school to go to my brother's funeral, and was back in school on the 8th. 

That day we were changing seats and when I moved to Chloe's table, she moved to a different one, leaving me alone with Delaney. Later, I asked Delaney for a pencil, and Chloe, seeing me, said ""You're cheating on me? We're through!"" in an exaggerated tone. I tried to ask her about this later but she ignores me. 

Finally, at the end of the day, when I caught with her and asked her, she said,  ""I was joking. You're Cody, no one wants to date you.""

Now I'm aware that this she's a rather insignificant person, who I have no attraction to, and that our non existent ""relationship"" means nothing to me now, but what kind of a fucked up joke is that?

"Just some notesDear Reddit,

Just some notes here. Not looking for much except for maybe general comments. I've never shared these with anyone in real life but since this is pretty anonymous (throw-away account) I thought I might as well after reading everyone else's posts.

My life so far has been pretty decent from the eyes of an outsider, I guess. I finished uni doing something I sort of enjoyed and I'm getting an advanced degree in the same field. I've travelled around the world and I've experienced a lot of things that many might not have the chance to experience, and I have a stable job, stable family relationship and some friends.

I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 9 due to family reasons. When I was in 7/8th grades, my biggest fantasy was to kill my parents in their sleep and then kill myself. I guess my closest attempt back then was taking around 20 tablets of antibiotics(which didn't do much except made me sick for a couple of days) but nothing more. Throughout high school I fantasized about death and would often purposefully put myself in dangerous situations such as sitting on the edge of a window or something silly like that. I guess it was not really anything serious as an attempt, but the fantasy felt extremely soothing and comforting in a sense. In uni I felt less like that, when I was dating my former significant other, who had MDD and had had multiple attempts, including experiences of hospitalization. I didnt quite understood what they were feeling back then I guess because my depression wasn't as serious as what they were experiencing. I, however, think I understand it now because I'm pretty sure that I'm in the same boat.

Because of my work I can reasonably gain access to certain materials that are able to kill me rather painlessly if calculated correctly. I have a date that I intend on carrying out this plan sometime in the near future after I've fulfilled some of my last promises to people, and I feel that this is an acceptable thing to do, for the following reasons:

- I've experienced most of the things that I believe that I should experience and I am able to say with certain confidence that if I die now I will not have regrets 
- my friends and family will be okay if they are aware of the end of my existence. It will come as an accident if done correctly and since I'm not really close to any of them, it will hurt a limited amount of people and I can't care enough (since I'll be dead)
- I despise myself and I can't really look at myself in the mirror without having the urge to spit in my face. I guess it would be ideal to live in a place without mirrors and without people so I wouldn't have to deal with it. But I thrive on human contact and it would be worse because I will probably kill myself unhappily rather than ambivalently
- If my attempt succeeds, then I won't have to care anymore. If it doesn't, I'll know what didn't work and gain more experience for the future
- I can't really function without the support of many different substances (like caffeine and antihistamines) and the dependence makes me sick. It needs to be broken

Honestly I don't see any downsides to my plan. But for the sake of debating I thought I'd share, because we tend to be blinded by our own views. Any thoughts will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",,Depressed

"For all you students, if you are struggling in a course or it is causing you too much stress, swap out of the class if you can, it will save you loads of time and stress. Warning: this may be a bit of a text wall, I’m on mobile and also kinda venting. For a TLDR, reread the title. This is also based primarily off of my experience and what happens at my school. If yours goes about things differently, please let me know thru dm or comment and I will edit accordingly. 

All of the adults in your life will try to influence you to do what they think is best for you, and sometimes they may be right. But in the end, it is your life. Live it however the hell you want to. 

I’m a current senior in high school and in my 4 years of high school, I’ve had about 6 courses that caused me far more stress and anxiety than the rest of my classes. Of those 6, I only dropped 2, including one within this past week. After making those changes, I felt my mental health skyrocket both times. Before making my first class swap, I was super deep into my depression, primarily because I had to pull all nighters every other day just to sort of keep up with the new vocab words (for german). Since I had already completed my schools graduation requirement for foreign language, I was able to drop the class. 

If you are a senior or late into junior year and are afraid a schedule change could affect your admissions to colleges, call or email the admissions offices of colleges you are applying or planning on applying to and straight up ask them if making this change would affect your admission standing. If you are a second semester senior, the answer will almost always be that it will not. 

And a piece of advice for the younger of you, if there is a class you really want to change but your school counselor or advisor or whomever helps you with your schedule tries to convince you to not take it, don’t be afraid to push back. One of the more frequent subjects this happens to is the fine arts, where y’all may be discouraged from taking that band class or this art class. But if you enjoy the activity, do it anyways. These classes provide a great break in the monotony of a school day and can be super fun. And if you decide you don’t like them, as before, you can just swap out. 

If you’ve made it this far, I hope you have a fantastic day and do something you feel proud of!",,Anxious

"Comparing and contrasting between cuddling with a cat and cuddling with another person. First off, cuddling with a cat. The feline family is NOT social. They dont hunt in packs and as a result they usually dont form strong bonds with others. This will result in your cat leaving in like 5 minutes. Another result of cats not being social is they tend to have anxiety a lot less often than humans do, which means they will not hesitate to just climb on your lap at will. They also wont think ""I wonder if they hate me?"" after they walk away. 
Second, cuddling with another person. Cuddling with another person (preferably the gender(s) that you are  romantically attracted to but not required) will most likely be superior in multiple ways. Humans DID hunt in groups when evolving. We form stronger bonds with others. Most primates are social. It is actually required to physically touch another person (NOT in a sexual way) in order to be healthy, because of this our brains will release dopamine AND serotonin when cuddling with someone you trust. There is a downside to this. If you're at the beginning of a relationship there will probably be anxiety and hesitation on both sides. For example: let's say you and someone else are laying next to each other in a single bed. Let's say you want to be in the big spoon cuddling position. In order to get in that position you have to press almost your entire body against theirs, AND wrapping your arms around them. If they trust you enough it is a really nice experience, however imagine the downfall if they don't. Little spoon basically cant move. Its situations like this that make cuddling with a cat superior. Then there is how many cuddling positions you can be in. Cats (at least my cat) will just lay on your chest, but human cuddling positions are much more numerous. For example: me and my cuddling partner. Sometimes we spoon, sometimes she lays on my chest, sometimes I lay on her chest. Different positions have different benefits.

"I'm drowning...Do you think it's possible to contaminate someone with your mere presence? My neice was born 3 weeks ago, I have yet to see her...Im afraid to. I feel like if my filthy body touches her precious skin I'll imbue her with my brokenness...that I'll taint her...

I'm so close to the edge, I'm literally days away from ending it. I'm so worthless, everything I touch turns to shit. I shouldn't be allowed near other people, I will only ruin them. 

I've spent my life being on the outside looking in, desperate for connection that I will never have. No one has or will ever truly love me, I'm such a sad waste of flesh...Im so tired of the pain I just want to go...i just want to join again with whatever was before and whatever is after...Im just so tired of being so desperately alone.

I don't want her to know me, I don't want her to see pictures of me, I don't want them to ever tell that beautiful baby about the ugliness that I was. If I leave a not that's all I feel I will say to my brother...ill beg him to never talk about me to her, so she never has the taint of me on her. I'm so sorry to my other brother what exposing his sons to me...they deserved so much better then me. But they are young they will forget. I've kept away from my family for months, I can't bare for them to see me, to see the rotten person I've always been but now I don't even rhat the luxury of being pretty on the outside to offset it...

They don't need me anyways I've always been the 5th wheel...I don't know why I was born, sometimes I feel like this lifetime was for me to feel loneliness and pain. And now I've had enough, I just want to go home...i just want to be back where it was oneness...in my soul I know that's what death is like, connecting again with the oneness, going home.",,Depressed

"Injury Ruling My LifeI'm 25 and I have a debilitating back problem (herniated disc) that makes everyday a struggle.  I've tried EVERYTHING to fix the problem - physical therapy, bed rest, exercise.  I can tell that the issue is on a one way path to more pain and suffering, as herniated discs don't really heal and back problems tend to just get worse.  Doctors tend to be pretty useless resources - ""Do more physical therapy, strengthen the core, blah blah blah"".  There clearly isn't a very effective solution.

I've had two back surgeries (discectomies) to ""fix"" the discs, and before each I had extremely traumatic amounts of pain.  Suicide definitely crosses my mind, as it seems like the only way for the physical pain to end.  It also doesn't help to be injured at this age amongst many very healthy individuals.

I had enough I went to his friend's house and talked on the phone with him I told him to stop this and nothing would happen.

He came with people to my door wanting to fight...I had a knife with me they pushed me on the ground I panicked and somehow I stabbed him (nothing serous btw just a scratch) then my grandma came and they ran

"I need y’all’s advice on this apology Hey r/teenagers! So I need your advice on this apology I have already sent to a girl I hurt in the past. Would you guys mind to take a look at it, any thoughts would be appreciated! :)

Apology:

Listen, I don’t really know if I got my point across in March when I apologized last. But I have done some really hard thinking over the past several months, and believe me, summer was one of the hardest portions of this, where I was constantly thinking about the past and what I did wrong, except for the times when I had my friends by my side, and then, just like that, nothing mattered for a few days, only until I got back home and thought of everything once more. I was venting to Ashton tonight and I actually scared him into thinking I was gonna off myself... which was entirely not my intention, I swear, I wouldn’t do that to him, not after all he and I have gone through. But it all stemmed back to one problem I haven’t been able to get past for multiple years now, and frankly it’s starting to affect me too much, I don’t know if you feel the same, but quarantine has changed everything, I’m now politically motivated and somewhat fit, which is kinda ironic ngl. Considering the state of affairs when we last spoke, where I was just starting to delve into theology and starting to better myself... I just thought that maybe, just maybe, we should repair what seventh grade, in my pride and spiteful attitude at the time, did to me and you respectively. I was trying to hurt you out of spite , anger and a lack of pride in myself that I have since regained. I guess my point in telling you about my life and the specifics of what has happened between me and Ashton over the past few hours, is that I feel like I screwed everyone’s, including yours and my, lives up in the process of whatever happened in seventh grade. I wish for you to be a part of our group again, as I have made my peace with Ryan, which admittedly, was a big step... considering my pure hatred for him in the past, which was unsubstantiated. Most of all, I wish for us to at least be on speaking terms once more, as I miss what we had, in our friendship I mean. I cried for the first time in a long time tonight. It was a long night, recalling all of the terrible things my selfish and arrogant ass did in the past, it truly brings my name to shame, and the names of my siblings and all those who came before me... I have the majority of my honour because of my actions all those years ago... I once again, am truly sorry for the truly horrid things I put you through in seventh grade... I hope that you’ll forgive me and maybe we could be friends or at least on speaking terms? I’m sorry this was super lengthy, I just had to get everything off of my chest, y’know. I’ve been carrying this burden for years and have decided that it’s time to release it all. You’re a really good person at heart and it seems like not all that much has changed since we last spoke on friendly terms, you are still a very good artist. Again, I am sorry for all of the things I did to you, my arrogance and pride got the better of me. I hope that maybe we can be on speaking terms, if not friends, the group kinda misses you... I know I miss your friendship. And with that, I formally apologize for what I did to you those several years ago.",,Stressed

BUT happiness isn't forever, lately she has been quite absent and she blames it on her being in a ""terrible mood"", which I know for sure isn't completely true cause I have first hand information from her bestfriend. 


Anyways , to make her recover her interest I've decided to create A VISUAL MASTERPIECE, my own ted talk about why she should date me.(I know this is not an original idea but given she's an artist and likes creative stuff I thought this would be around her taste)

I thought about creating a PowerPoint and writing the script with my 2007 Microsoft Word (yeah I'm so cool ik). In my future oscar winning masterpiece I'll add slides talking about the interests we share, reminding her of some good situations we've gone through together and yeah more stuff, which I really dont know now, OH and also some fresh as memes 

I know this was tedious to read but I'm so nervous about all this, I would appreciate if you guys shared your opinion about this idea

"The lack of Donald Trump porn makes me worry about this generation 😩 I 👁 have accepted 🤝 long 🍆 ago 😅 that real 💯, authentic ✔ Donald 👑 Trump 👑 porn 🍑🍆💦 is never 🚫 going 👉 to become 😌 available 😎. For years 🗓, the best 👌😬 that I 👁 could do to satisfy 😊 my kink ⛓ was to create 💯 the porn 😜 myself. My only option 🍎 was to crudely 👺 photoshop 🖥 Donald 👑 Trump's 👑 head 💆 onto 🐦 the bodies 😍👗 of male 👬👅⤴ pornstars. But 🍑 my limited ❌ photoshop 🖥 skills ✍ could only accomplish 💰 so much 🔥. No 🚫 matter 🙅 how hard 🍆 I 👥 tried 👀 to make 🖕 my fantasy 😴🤯 into reality 💯, I 👁 could never ❌ make 💘 it feel 😁 real 😍. 

But 🍑 technology 💡 has advanced 🎊 since 👨 then. Humanity 👤 has evolved 🚶🐆🐇. We have once again ❌😬 made 👑 contact 📞 with the monolith of the universe 🌌⚡🎆, and from this advancement 🎊 has emerged deepfake porn 🍑. 

We have the ability 💪 to put 😏 anyone's 🎖 face 😀 onto 🐦 any pornographic 😩💦 video 📹🎥📽. Anyone 🙋. So is it too much 🔥 to ask 🤔⁉❓ that porn 😜 is made 👑 out of the most famous 😎 man 👱🏻👨🏼👴🏻 in America 🇺🇸? 

Honestly 😇, at this point 📍 I 👥 am so desperate 😔 for Donald 👑 Trump 👑 porn 🔥🍑 that I 👁 will watch 👀 anything 😯. But 🍑 if I 👁 could create 😮 a video 📼 myself, he 👥 would be on 🔛 bottom ⬇👟. 

Now I'm 💘 going ⏩🏃 to be honest 😇 here. I 👁 don't ❌🚫👺 align ✋ myself with most of Barack 🤖 Obama's 👨🏿 political 🏛 views 📕. But ✋🍑 if I'm 💘 basing this on 🔛 facts ☑ alone 🙀🙃, then, statistically 📶, Obama 👦 is likely 🤪 to have a larger ➕ penis 🍆 than any other living 🙅 U.S 🇺🇸. president 🇺🇸. This would mean 😏 that, in my ideal 💡 Trump 👑 porno 😳⤴💦, Barack 😊 Obama 🍆👦🏾 would have to be on 🔛 top 🔝👁. 

I 👁 have created 💯 a rough 🤕 outline 👙 of how this porno 👉👌 would play 🎮 out: 

I 👁 have debated with myself whether 🌩🌧 or not there should be a plot 😤🍑 to this porno ❌. In many 👬 pornographic 🔞🔥 videos 📼, the plot 📉 is not very ✅ good 👌. Many 👬 people 👫👬👭 skip 🐧 the beginning 🏁 setup ℹ entirely 🎬 and get 🔟 straight 💑 to the sex 👉👌 scenes 🎬. But 🍑 I 👁 think 💭 the only reason 🌟 that the plots 📈📚📊 of pornos ❌ are boring 😴💤 is that the acting 🎭 is never ❌ very 👌 good 👌. So if I 👁 were able 💪 to get 🉐 good 💯👍 actors 🎭 to star 🌠⭐🌟 in this porno ❌, the plot 😤🍑 would be a much 🔥 better 👍 experience 🖐 and people 👨 would enjoy 😂 it a lot 🍑 more. I 👁 think 💭 Samuel L 🅰🅱. Jackson 🤹🏿‍♂️ would make 🖕 a great 🇬🇧 Barack 😊 Obama 👦 and John ✔ Goodman would make 💘 a great 👍 Donald 👑 Trump 🍊. They are aboth critically 🏥 acclaimed actors 🎭, and their bodies 😍👗 are built 🔧🔨 similarly 🔷🔶♦ to their respective 😁🤤 roles 😩. 

In the opening 👐 shot 🔫, Barack 🤖 Obama 👦 would be sitting 💺 alone 👤 at his 👋 home 🏠. His 👋 wife 👩🏼 and kids 👦🏻 are on 🔛 vacation 🏖 with his 👋 wife's 👰🏼 parents 👫. He 👨 is watching 👀 Fox 🦊 News 📰 (don't 🚫 worry 😟 he's 👨 just watching 👀 it ironically 😂) and he 👥 says 💬 ""Fuck 🖕🍆🍑 Republicans 👯🙏🏻💯."" It is at this moment 😳 that Donald 👑 Trump 🍊 breaks 💔 down 🔻 his 👋 door 🚪 and says 🗣, ""Will you 👈 fuck 🖕 this republican 👯🙏🏻💯?"" Obama 🍆👦🏾, already 👋 sweating 🤤💦🚿 heavily 🏋️‍♂️, utters 🐄 ""B-But 😞😳 orange 🍊💼 man 👨 bad 👎."" And then Trump 🍊👨 says 🗣, ""Yeah 🙌, this orange 🍊😜 man 👨🏽 can be very ✅😲 bad 👎 owo 😺😻👅."" 

Obama 👦 hastily 💨 rips 😂🧃 off 📴 his 💦 pants 👖 and exposes 😩 his 💦 13 💯 inch 😲 cock 🍆. Trump's 👑 knees 👖 go 🏃 weak 👶 at the sight 👀 of this and he 👥 immediately 😤 falls 🍁 to the floor 🤣. He 👨 crawls 🐀🐁 up 👆⬆ to Obama 👦 and Obama 👦🏾🆗 whispers 🗣 to him 👨 ""No 🙅 wall 🧱🎶🎵 would be able 💪 to keep 👌 me out (of your 👉 ass 🍑)."" 

Going 🏃 along 💁 with the typical 😂 porno 👉👌 formula 💹, the first 👆 1/3 😍😳💯 of the sex 🍑🍆💦 is oral 💋. Trump 🍊🧍, his 💦 lips 👄💋 already 😞 moist 💦, plunges 😵😲😩 his 💦 face 😀 violently 💣 into Obama's 👨🏿 crotch ◀ and practically ❤ inhales 😮💦 his 💦 penis 🍆👈👴🏻.

Trump 🍊 slightly 👌 regurgitates that morning's 🌄 Big 🍆 Mac 🍔 onto 😂 Obama's 👨 penis 🍆, but 🍑 they don't 🚫 even 🌃 care 💅. They are filled 👉👌 with desire 😍 for each other. Before ⬅ Obama 🍆👦🏾 can explode 💥💦🍆 his 💦 molten pearls 📀 inside 💠 of Trump's 👑 weathered mouth 💋, Trump 👑 pulls 🐙 away 😐 from the 17 🕚 inch 😲 shaft 🍆, leaving 🍃 greasy 🍕 orange 🍊 spray 💦 tan 💯 all 💯 over 😳🙊💦 Obama's 👨🏿 jungle 🌳🌴🌍 of pubic 🍆 hairs 💇. 

Trump 🍊 turns 💃 around 🔃 and reveals 👀 his 💦 large 👆 hammy 🐷 slappers 👋🏻, with a small 👌 puckered 😱 hole ⛳ in between 👉👈, to Obama 👦🏾. Obama 👦, not even 🌃 applying 🙋 the smallest 👌🏼🥇 amount 💯 of lube 🙊💦😩, plunges 🤺 with full 🌝 force 👮 into Trump's 👑 wet 💦 depths 🤔🙀👽. The girthy 😫 anaconda 🐍 that is Obama's 👨 penis 👽🍆 slithers 🐍 its way 💫 through the many 👬 feet 👣 of Trump's 👑 intestines 😂. Along 🕺💃 the way ↕, lots 🍑 of moist 👍 feces 💩 from the inside 😂 of Trump's 🍊 poop 😆💩 tubes 🚇 coats 🧥 Obama's 👨🏿 shaft 🍆. The friction 🍌 of the monstrous 🐲👺👹 beast 🐂 slithering 🐍 through the inside 💠 of Trump 👑 stimulates 💡 his 💦 prostate 🍑😍. Trump's 🍊🧍 cheeks 🤜🍑🤛 grow 💗 hot 😅 and pink 💖. His 💦 orange 🍊 penis 🍆 is fully 🌝 erect ⬆ and throbbing 💢 with passionate 🍑 desire 🐅, but 🍑 you 👈 can't 🚫 see 👀 it because it is surrounded ⚰ by pounds 🤜💪🍆 and pounds 🤜💥 of moist 💦, sweaty 💦 blubber. 

Obama's 👨 cock 🐓😳 is inside 😂 of Trump's 👑 stomach 😎🤑 at this point 📍. His 💦 tingly, gurgling 🤮 stomach 🐡 acids ⚗ are oddly 😜🤥 erotic 😩. In unison 🙏💯, Trump 🍊 and Obama 🍆👦🏾 both say 💬🙈 ""Oh 🙀 fuck 🖕👌 I'm 💘 gonna 👉 cum 💦🎅🏼."" And at that moment ⚠, a monumental 🏢 explosion 💥🔥💦 happens 💦🍆😍. Obama's 👨🏿 penis 🍆 violently 🔫 sneezes 🤧😷🤒 its gallons 😩😂 and gallons 😩😂 thick 😫👌, sticky 💦, sweet 🍬 milk 🍼 inside 💠 of Trump 👑.

My mom said I can do anything I want, except try to commit suicide, but isn't it my fault that I was born that way? I also wish I didn't feel like dying, but I can't do anything. I can do anything i want but the only thing i want is to die and she won't let me do that.
I also hate my mother for protecting me too much since childhood, and now I don't know how to do anything without her help, and when she dies i know I won't have the money to buy food and I will starve (which doesn't scare me much , since I also have an eating disorder and can't wait to starve and die). I never had a job and I don't even know how I would start looking for one (and I can't, because the pandemic is screwing everything up), and I actually don't really need to work because I'm in college but I hate fucking college, I hate this stupid course that I chose because I didn't have suicidal thoughts at the time i started it and I didn't know I would ever feel like this. Even if I somehow manage to graduate and get a job (I don't think I will, because I suck at everything and I don't know how to do anything), I know that I'll never be able to work as a psychologist, because I won't trust myself to treat someone with suicidal thoughts when I have them myself and I can understand exactly what the person is feeling. If I'm going to be a psychologist and I still haven't found reasons not to kill myself, I would never be a hypocrite to the point of trying to get someone else to find reasons for themselves.
I hate college and I want to quit, but I can't because it's the only thing I do, and my mom agrees that I don't need to get a job until I finish studying, but not having a job makes me feel worthless, and at the same time i don't want to be stuck in a horrible job (i don't care if it pays too little, i'm just afraid it's a job i hate). So I can't drop out of college, but I also don't believe in the shit they're teaching me and I know I won't be able to help anyone.

i’ll admit i haven’t been the perfect daughter to them because of my mental health issues and i’m not trying to use that as an excuse but it’s difficult when i constantly have manic episodes and then depressive episodes or when i get panic attacks with little things or anger out bursts, but i do try, i’ve always tried to make them proud of me by doing things my siblings were doing or doing things they wanted me to do, but nothing was ever good enough for them and it made me more mad and drove me crazy, i try to always express my feelings to them like this but they just act like they are saints and have done nothing wrong to me because they took me in when they didn’t have to and gave me food and a roof over my head, or when i bring up my mom babying my other siblings they’ll tell me not to bring them up life isn’t always going to be my way. it bothers me, it probably shouldn’t but it does. i don’t know whats wrong with me??? 
i can’t stand living here, i’ve saved up money from jobs i’ve had but i’d always have to pay for things i needed like clothes or underwear, socks, etc because my parents wouldn’t buy me them anymore when needed because i have a job, i’m capable of taking care of myself, or my mom will take money out of my account for something i needed to pay her back, she once took out $81 from my savings which i was saving to move out because she had bought me a christmas present that was around $80. 
i don’t know how much longer i can take this, its driving me insane, i’m not even allowed in my room anymore because its their “punishment” to me for misbehaving, i sleep in the living room couch now. i’m at my limit, i have nobody to talk to i can’t see a psychiatrist or therapist because i don’t have insurance and my parents wont let me get insurance if i talk about it they yell at me. 
my dad has also told me to go kill myself again and make sure to do it properly this time, and i’m considering it. i know they’ll be better off without me. 
i don’t know what to do anymore, if somebody has anything i can do or any advice i’ll take it.",,Depressed

Life has always thrown shit my way but now it’s so unbearable and out of control I don’t want to be here anymore. This has by far been the worst year of my life and I’ve been through so much in the last 5 months. More than one person would go through in a lifetime! That’s never mind the years previously full of abuse and suffering! 

I’m so comfortable with death now, I long for it to happen to take me away from the pain and grief and suffering I have every single day! 

I just need a hug, someone to take me in their arms and say it will be ok but I have no one to even do that! 

I’m tired of wondering where the next meal is coming from and when my house will be taken from me, and watching people fall apart around me whilst I’m expected to be strong and sort everything out constantly!!! 

I can’t do it anymore... I don’t want to do it anymore... I need someone to be strong for me, do things for me! But I have no one to do that because my life is fucked with no family apart from my kids and no friends! 

I doubt I will take my life, I’ve tried and failed so many times. And anyway I usually stop half way through with the guilt of hurting other people. As usual I never think of myself, ALWAYS everyone else before me and that’s why I’m in this mess right now.

"So hopelessI'm 19 years old. Background: I have OCD and anxiety issues. 
I feel like such a fucking dumbass. Last year at this time I started feeling ""foggy"". It's so hard to describe but it's hell on earth. It feels like I'm a little drunk, like I can't focus on things, like I have a clouding of consciousness. It's absolute torture 24/7. Well, the doctors told me it was anxiety after a ton of tests, and I was put on an SSRI. I gradually got better and eventually returned basically to normal. In come alcohol. Of course I can't drink like a normal person. Of course I HAD to have the personality where I binge every time like a fucking irresponsible dumbass. I drank regularly for the last 7-8 or so months. In that time I've blacked out probably 4-6 times. Each time it happened I told myself I would change but i couldn't. I'm weak. I can't drink like a normal person. Well, I could just quit drinking, and have decided to completely quit. But, this is where my original story comes in. The awful feeling, the torture, the complete hell on earth, is back. My mind feels like it's only half on and there's nothing I can do to fix it. It happened after I was a dumbass and blacked out AGAIN. I'm so stupid, if I had just drank like somebody who had half a goddamn sense of intelligence I'd be fine. But no, I can't. I woke up the day after and noticed my mind was back in the torture. Back in the fucking thick of it. What if it's permanent this time? So here I am, trapped in my own version of fucking hell and I can't even say it's not my fault I guess.

Infront of people i'm tense and anxious and the second I'm alone again I just break down, overcome by loneliness, regret and guilt. Using various drugs and alcohol to distract myself but it's unsustainable and there is no ""fix"". I've tried dating, socialising and stuff but there's only one person i've ever loved and there's never been another person I even *enjoyed* the company of. All I can imagine in my future is loneliness, a pointless job with a pointless existence and *always* missing my ex. I can't physically do it, falling asleep can take me hours, even after 2-3 days without sleep plus drinking and taking various drugs I will lay in bed for hours crying, stuck in various daydreams involving my ex etc. Sober it's *far worse*. There's no chance of fixing that now but life goes on, they're better off without me. So I *have* to work 40-45 hours a week, in some mundane, shitty paying job just for the liberty of living, except I hate *living*, no amount of money, drugs or anything is going to change that and the only reason I have not to end it all is my ""one"" family member who would be hurt.

"Should I get new friends? Hello, two days ago I asked a friend of mine who I thought was pretty close with me if he wanted to go hammocking with me during virtual school (I’m a junior in hs) and he said he can’t but we agreed on him calling me a bit after school was done to let me know he was coming over to pick me up. Well I waited and waited, but I was super bummed when night came around and he hadn’t called back. I found out later that night that he hung out with two other best friends of mine because they sent photos in the gc. So I was even more bummed, I know I probably should’ve called and asked what was up but I didn’t want to seem needy because to be honest these were the first real friends I’ve made and I didn’t want to mess things up. I feel like they mean more to me than I do to them. The next day he doesn’t ever message back or call so I decided I’d just move on and try to make some better friends because I had always felt like I didn’t fit in but this just confirmed it. Anyways today he messaged me and told me the same friends were coming over to his house to spend the night and if I wanted to come. I didn’t respond and a few minutes later the other friends call me. I didn’t pick up I just let it ring, I really thought these guys were my bros but I feel betrayed and kind of alone now. In a few years I probably will forget all about this and just chalk it up to high school drama but rn it still hurts a little. Anywho, should I just ignore any further messages and just move on and drop these “friends?” I wish I could call them and say what’s up with him ghosting me when we were supposed to go hiking but I’m not a conflict person and I’m worried that he may just make a good excuse and I’ll just fall for it because I am kinda desperate.

\- You have to take it out of the steam oven when the time is right. Don't be afraid to discard the liquid unless you are a gravy queen, and for the love of God get rid of the soggy skin! Feed it to ur dog or something.

I simply cannot bear it one more day to hear of the suffering in the world... my fellow companions on earth being tortured, abused, raped, murdered. It breaks my heart so much whenever I hear of something sad, I uncontrollably sob for quite a while. How could someone so sensitive be made for this world? My heart simply cannot bear it.

PLEASE do not let my death be in vain. This is all I want. Love each other. Hold and support each other. Don't pass judgement so easily. Refrain from hurting others needlessly for your convenience. LOVE OPENLY. Just writing this down makes my heart ache with unbearable sadness, the fact that these horrors actually exist. Please, fill your life with love, happiness, and compassion. If that was common in this world, I'd still be here. Do not let another one go like me. Give that person all the compassion and love in the world. 

It's nobody's fault. I am just not made for this place. Don't cry over me. Focus that energy in loving and supporting someone who is alive and needs it. If you really do miss me, then just do anything you can to make the world a better place.

Don't be sad for me. I am at this moment while you're reading this reuniting with my soulmate, my everything, my whole world.

Im 23 year old guy, turning 24 in august.

I come from a stable middle class family, and have never really had any financial struggles growing up. My parents were always supportive of me and loved me, but had relatively high expectations of me. They were both successful doctors and had made a respectable name for themselves within the community and within our family. Everything growing up was good, but ive never been happy.

My family was also pretty good, My sister and I were okay, we got along. I didn't get along to well with my dad, but we still cared for each other.. and my mom, my mom was my number 1 in everything. She was the main reason that i wasn't going to commit, but ever since she passed away from cancer, i dont know anymore.

Ive been descriminated against my entire life, for being a muslim in america. Ive been called terrorist, suicide bomber, sand ni\*\*\*\*, and have been told to kill myself many, MANY times. Even my teacher was openly racist against me. 9/11 happened when i was in kindergarten, so yea, basically my whole life. All throughout elementary and middle school i never made any friends, and had created a brick wall to prevent anyone from actually negatively impacting me with their hate. But i didnt realize my own thoughts would eat at me faster than their words.

The primary source of it -my depression, my suicidal thoughts, my zero will to live- is from school.

It began in highschool (from what i remember, maybe earlier). At the age of 14, i began struggling with school. My ideology was, whats the point of this if im never going to use it? But whatever, i stuck t it since i made some lifelong friends and i did fine and graduated with a mediocre GPA  and started college that same summer of 2014..

College came, and everyone says these are the ""best years of your life""....

Ever since college began, Ive never felt more alone than i have in my entire life, I rarely made any friends, and the friends i did make all eventually abandoned me. Ive never had a relationship, yet have been led on and had my heart broken countless times. I had my mom that was there for me 24/7, but i was always afraid to tell her how much my heart hurt, it just seemed pointless to tell her, so i just stayed quiet. for years and years i stayed quiet.

In my first year of college, my mother got a cancerous mass, but got it removed and beat cancer the first time. Although it was a win, the recovery was hell and she never really got back to 100% again. Two years later in my third year of college, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and fought long and hard for a year and a half, but she didnt make it. For the entire time she had cancer, i had the absolute hardest time in school. I couldnt focus, i couldnt think, and i simply didnt care about anything else knowing that my mom is in pain. I failed numerous classes and was put back quite a bit.

But with my mom having cancer, we talked alot more often since she couldn't work anymore, the time i spent with her skyrocketed and i opened up to her about nearly everything in my life. I even told her how i at one point tried to hang myself.

Opening up to her releived alot of pain, more than you can imagine. But the pain quickly came back.. Every time i saw my mother in pain from chemo or from the variety of tumors, every time i would her her scream in pain, i would completely break down. Everything i did was to ease her pain and to make her happy. EVERYTHING i did, i wouldve swapped places with her without question. And to this day i wish it was me who had cancer instead of her. My mother was an absolute angel and i would've literally taken a bullet for her.

October 17, 2019 at 1:55 am, she passed. And although i was relieved that she wasnt in pain anymore, it hurt like hell. I had promised my mom that i would be strong for my dad and my sister. That i would be the new backbone of the family and hold everything together. I knew it was going to be hard, but ive already sacrificed so much of my happiness, i guess ive gotten used to it.

Months went by and we recovered slowly, I was still struggling with school and work, and still am to this day. I promised my mom that i would graduate and be successful and get married and have a happy life, but im not sure i can anymore.

I was doing good i thought, until this whole covid-19 bullshit came about. It impacted my school since online teaching really isnt for me, but eventually i adapted. I was doing good and all, but whats pushing over the edge now is my professor falsely accusing my of academic misconduct on a final exam that i didnt even do good on (63%). And now because of this, is threatening to report me to the committee and kick me out of school.

I know it seems like a bullshit reason.. to kill myself over a simple fucking test. But whats the point? 6 years of non-stop struggling. Half of which was me trying to overcome the fact that my mom had cancer. All going to waste simply because this professor has it out for me.

So if you see this professor Schmidtmayerova, know that you were the tipping point.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been discriminated against. and been told to kill myself numerous times,

Ive been alone my entire life and lost the only person i genuinely care about,

Ive felt like a failure for years and years on end

Ive never found love, and not sure i ever will

and i dont see myself ever being successful in the future.

So someone tell me, whats the point?",,Depressed
"I can't do it anymore. I can't keep going alone and single. I don't have it in me. I am done.I am turning 38 next month and have spent since the age of 29 in the dating scene on every dating site free and paid and have yet to have found anyone.

I have spent my entire life alone, no family, single, homeless and have been to many states and done many things even owned 4 businesses. I have spent my entire life trying to lose weight but unable to lose it. finding out my body is fighting against me and making me obese.

I have spent eight years in the dating scene not had one date and only getting rejected because of my weight or finding women who just play games or married women who are separated and not divorced. I am not into any of that.

I have spent 8 years in the dating scene trying to find a woman to date and settle down with. Past 8 years I have been rejected around 2000 + times and told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer a woman or give a woman, mocked at laughed at, told I don't deserve love or a relationship, told I needed to end my life for being so fat and lazy.

Past 8 years I have been lead on by 22 women who pretended to love and want me and lead me on for 3 months or more sweet talking me telling me they love me and making plans for us then would fake their death or call me while having sex with someone or would disappear on me to never be heard from again.

I don't have it in me to try anymore. I am just done. I can't do it anymore.

I don't feel like it is worth it anymore trying. I don't feel like trying to find someone anymore is worth it. I dunno if its just my age, getting older, or what but I just don't know anymore.",,Depressed

"My girlfriend fucked me over BACK STORY:

we met properly at a club and made out numerous times, I caught feelings because it felt so passionate. 

She’s the girl that I met at the wrong time and later then got to know each other better at the right time. Anyways, we talked a lot within the first week and snapped while complimenting each other until we got to meet again one on 
one. 

We were walking to a quiet park in the evening where nobody would see us, we talked and talked and she was just so pretty and cute. We both knew what was going to happen I had the hottest hook up I had with her where I would touch all around her with my shirt off and even finger her, those moans kept me up all night and want to go on. She told her friends about me how ‘experienced’ I was and how I knew what I was doing, when I found out I was so happy to hear about it. Her friends talked to me about what she said about the experience saying that she also liked me too and she loved the feeling.

Throughout the following week we snapped more and more. Saying things like “why you so cute” or “missing you sm” or “my clothes smell like you”, at one time she said “I know this sounds so soon but I just can’t wait to be your girlfriend” I was so excited. I decided to arrange a dinner date with her. On the day we had our date it was awesome and stuff though we didn’t do any action but I was okay with that.

Now, a few days later I received a snap from her, I remember it so well it said “hey I’m sorry this might be really out of the blue but I’ve been thinking it’d be better if we were off as just friends” followed by another one saying “I’m sorry I just didn’t want to lead you on”. 

In my head I was like what are you talking about? I was confused and slowly began to cry it out, I sort of broke down and felt like absolute shit thinking what went wrong? Was I too clingy? Was I rushing? It seemed all fine to me. Ofc I couldn’t do anything about it and that it’d be hard to change her perspective of me. it’s only been a few weeks and lead to this. All those snaps, texts and that date meant nothing to the relationship. I mean she’s a friend now I get it’s not gonna hurt anything more but still the relationship itself punched a hole deep inside me and I was hurt. 

Now since I guess she’s my ex now I’ve recently started missing her so much in every way, her body, her face, her voice and moans almost in a sexual way though I still have feelings for her at the moment. I’ve been thinking would it be possible if I’d see her at the club when she goes out again and hook up with her without having any lingering romantic feelings like friends with benefits. 

I just don’t know what to do now I feel like I’m stuck in a loop.",,Normal

I am 15F my boyfriend is 16F, usually we make out for about 30 minutes and then he starts fingering me and after a while i jack him off and he has tried to finish me but i told him not to expect it as it is really difficult and pretty rare for me to actually finish. He is super sweet and tried his best several times but i told him (which i do actually feel this way 100%) that i dont need to finish to have fun and it's not really a main focus.

How can i finish while with him? I am not ready for oral/anything more than we've already done.

Also she felt like she could have been ignored while me and the boys were “having fun”. We once again slept in tents and I only slept with her during mornings and afternoons as she stayed up late. She also looked around for me and flirted with me, at one point we even cuddled while she was not wearing her bra (why is that do all girls get rid of it during rest?

"Some of you are insensitive little pieces of shit and I hate all of you who say #AllBuildingsMatter No I’m not directly attacking anybody in this sub Reddit whatsoever I’m just directing it towards everyone because I’m fucking sobbing. 

I have never actually listened to any of the phone calls of people on the planes or in the buildings or crying and begging for help from the operaters asking what to do or the one man saying ""we’re all going to die"" right before it hit the building. Those building were made of fucking steel columns, that plane should have crumpled on impact but the bombs went off in the plane and that's how it went through. I can't even tell if I'm spelling shit right because I can't stop crying but I just can't help but think what if I got a phone call like that from my mom, or dad, or my boyfriend knowing in minutes they would be dead. 

One woman who was 50 described her last phone call with her husband who she met when she was 16 years old and he told her that he was trying to find a way out and he couldn’t get the stairwell was just filling with smoke and she asked him if it hurt to breathe and he said no because he didn’t want to worry her. And they just talked about all their happiest memories together before he just wispered over and over I love you before the building just cracked. And she called his name over and over and there was no response. 

Over 200 people jumped out of the building that day. Just Imagine, the roads littered not just the bodies of the trapped people in the trade centers doing anything to escape, but of the people they landed on. One man who jumped landed on a firemen and killed them both. I just prayed to God that I or anyone I love never have to experience this first hand or have to hear a phone call from them or me saying I love you one last time.

"An old friend...I had a friend for a few months. He and I became the closest I had ever been with anybody. It wasn’t a romantic relationship or anything, although at points I felt like it should be. He told me he didn’t want that kind of relationship with me, probably because I was too young  and too immature for him. 

A little while later I found my self longing to be in a deeper relationship with him, not even necessarily romantic. Just more connected. But I felt like he didn’t want that, so I got really upset. I cut myself a few times, even though he told me that if he caught me cutting again he would tell my parents. 

Then I saw him a few days later and he discovered that I had been cutting. I felt really... I don’t know, dramatic? I wanted to push his buttons. So I told him that I did it because I was thinking about being with him and I cut myself because he had made it clear that he didn’t want that. After all this was revealed, he told me that he shouldn’t talk to me anymore. 

He told my parents everything I had told him, and then left, never to reenter my life. My parents said that they convinced him to talk to me again, but he never did. He was supposed to go to a show I was helping out with, and I waited for him to show up the whole time. He never came. From that point on I’ve been crushed. I feel like I ruined things and I’m worthless and he doesn’t care about me and never did. Like he was just trying to be nice. I tried to contact him a little while ago, explaining myself, but he never replied.

"I'm planningI have a bottle of zopiclone sleeping pills with 2 refills. They're 7.5mg pills. I figured I need about 20 pills to do it when combined with alcohol. I'll probably take them in the tub so at least when I get drowsy I'll drown as a second measure.   

I've tried everything to feel better. So many people in my life have died. My great grandma was raped and murdered, my best friends - my brother Chad and my cousin Geoffery, are both gone. My brother was murdered, ran over by a guy after a fight on a farm road with no one else around and the guy was never charged. My cousin Geoff killed himself. My mom &amp; dad are depressed and barely holding on after losing their son. I tried having a baby, and it was the happiest I have ever been. Then she had a birth defect, her organs were outside of her body. I didn't want to have an abortion. I truly believed our family had enough tragedy and she would live. There was a chance. I went into labor at 7 months pregnant. I held my beautiful little girl in my arms and fell in love. Her lungs were too small. Doctors said she wouldn't survive. We pulled the breathing tubes out and I watched her asphyxiate to death.   

I can't do it anymore. I feel so weak. My parents will die and my husband will die and I can't bear it. I don't want to be here for that. This world is horrible and cruel.   

I am seeing a therapist and it seems to help a little but only the days I see her. I tried anti-depressants and the symptoms were horrifying. I felt like my head was going to explode and I was so drowsy and nauseous.   

I try taking my dogs for walks. I try appreciating the beauty in things. I do yoga. I take vitamins. I drink lots of water. I cut out coffee. I try to think positive and keep busy. But the feelings of overwhelming sadness suck me in. I can barely function. I miss her and want to be with her. Please don't tell me you're sorry. Please, don't say ""I'm sorry for your loss"". It only reminds me of how much of a tragic broken human being I am.

"People of r/teenagers, let's save the world.   

My fellow Zoomers, in a few short weeks the state of the world may change drastically. The 2020 Election will be like if the 2000 one took 10 steroids and 3 vitamin gummies, and will lead our two preceding generations towards favoring either Anarchy or Oppression. The next few months and the coming years will be the greatest test we as teenagers will face, but we must summon our inner strength to protect or regain the freedoms that we have now or have remaining. We must be the bulwark of Democracy, not just in America, but everywhere in the world. Change the system we must.

I am calling upon all of us to take part in this great endeavor, to preserve our liberty and reestablish our equality, and to give a voice to those with none. The road will be long, it will not be pretty, and it will be very, very hard. Our individualism will be tested, our faith in humanity shaken, and our hope taxed. But I believe that with the use of the technology we now have at our fingertips, we can, and should most certainly try to make a better society in all our homelands.

Many of our elders will say that we shouldn't worry about it. That this is nothing, and that we have no control over it anyway. Well, the Boomers say nothing’s wrong, our Gen-Xer parents are either pessimist or pretending while telling us not to worry, and our Millennial siblings are too woke for their good. We are all that stands between the world we live in now, and a Dark future where none of the problems we see get solved.

I know that many of you believe that we can’t do anything. “We can’t vote, therefore we have no voice” you may already be typing into the comments below. I say that’s bullshit, all the memes I see on Cowbelly and in my feed are likely made by a Zoomer. And in these memes, I see an Angry generation, yet also one that knows that things can be different, things can be better. We know what’s wrong with the systems that have been put in place. Better yet, thanks to the massive information on the internet, we no longer have to rely only on our Public Schools or College professors to learn about History or get our news only from the TV or Newspaper. The problem is we’re a generation of Nihilists.

Consider the following, Historians William Strauss and Neil Howe created a Generational Model. 4 types of generations exist, and they occur typically one after another, and are as follows. Idealists are born during Conformity and come of age during Social Ferment, they Pursue Individualism and Morality. They become Visionaries, The Bill Gates, the Steve Jobs, the JFK’s. These are what the Boomers once were. Next is Reactives who are born during times of social change, and come of age during the previous gens push for Morality. They Shoulder a crisis, and age into Dim respectable people. These are the Gen-Xer’s i.e. Our Parents, who are now starting to become just as stressed as we are with the realization of the coming crisis. Next one is the Civics, who are born during a return to morality and unite during a crisis, they build the next society. The Millenials were supposed to be this. That brings it to us, the Adaptives, born during a crisis these people work for compromise during times of change, and tend to become sensible elders. The problem is, the crisis came late. The crisis should have been the 2008 economic crisis, but that got fixed fairly quickly. We were born too early to fulfill this model, and the millennials became more and more conscious of the social issues in society. Now they think they know everything, but they are being manipulated by the same people who caused those social issues in the first place.

Therefore, we must be the civics in their place. The children are the future, and since those with a voice are either too cynical, blind, or unaware of effectively change, we must do so instead. It is our responsibility to deal with this crisis so our descendants might not have to suffer another. And we have the tools, we just need to change our mindset from doomer to bloomer. This may be our only chance, and take it we must. This never was about making sure America could remain a Buffer against Chinese Hegemony, I wrote my first post to test the waters, to see how you would react. I saw people who know how to remain civil even if arguing about politics hence the references to China, that gives me hope. This is about showing the world that just because you can’t vote, it does not mean you don’t have a voice. I’m talking about being taken seriously gentlepeople.

That’s all it takes to push me down. That one bad thought or comment will make me feel self-conscious throughout the whole day and keeps me from talking. I’m also sensitive as hell. If I speak in a group chat and no one responds, I will dwell on it for hours with the thought as I’m not liked. Deep down I know I have friends that care yet I still feel alone. I KNOW I have friends, yet I feel like I have no friends (I can’t explain this feeling). I feel my heart hurting everyday. That “pain, pressure, tightness” physical feeling in my chest. Even when my thoughts stops, that constant, dull feeling of sadness still lingers. It hurts so bad to the point where I don’t want to be alive anymore. I’m tired of waiting for things to get better.

"Thoughts from a ""survivor""I attempted suicide on New Year's Day, 2020. 2019 was not kind to me at all, and I was not willing to spend another year in misery. The previous night was spent with the last few folks I truly care about, and when I left,  I held my best friend extra tight knowing it would be the last time. I fully intended to die that day, and to be honest, I should have... but a small oversight in my planning caused my attempt to fail. 

What are my thoughts since then? More of the same, except worse. I've never felt so hopeless, useless, or isolated in my life, only now with an extra sprinkling of guilt. I keep to myself because in the past, when I've reached out the other person either used the information I told them against me, or just stopped interacting with me. Can't say I blame them. I've tried talk therapy and medication over the last 13 years to no avail. This second chance at life has just turned out to be a second chance to be even more miserable. I'm tired.

"Writing stuff outHey, not sure if I'm going to hit submit on this or not. If you're reading this I guess I did.

I can't keep feeling like I do now. I have no energy, I don't want to do anything, I've worn out my ability to cry so now I'm just an empty numb shell waiting for it all to be over. There hasn't been a point in the last 2 years where I consciously thought I wanted to live life, at best I've been indifferent- maybe if there was a fire and someone was trapped inside I could run inside and help, and if I died at least it would be for a good cause, that kind of thinking.

A few months ago stuff got a lot worse and I don't know why. I asked my doctor if he would run any tests and he said no, I asked to see a psychiatrist 8 weeks ago and I'm still waiting, I'm on antidepressants that I know aren't going to work because it's week 8 already but the last mental health person I talked to told me it was too soon to try something else so I'm just stuck day after day after day not wanting to carry on. A couple of times recently I've been really close. 2 weeks ago I went to buy a rope and stopped before I did it but I don't understand why, it wasn't a conscious decision or anything.

I feel like I owe it to my mum to try speaking to a psychiatrist, and if that hasn't worked after a few weeks, if I feel like this again, I can just stop. It would suck making my mum upset but if she knew how i was feeling she would understand. Honestly the only thing keeping me from doing it right now is knowing I can just do it later if I don't seem to be getting any better, if I knew for a fact I had no chance of improving in the next month or two I would just kill myself now. I guess it's kind of like I'm finding an excuse to keep living a bit longer, because I know I shouldn't feel like this, but I know I don't have the strength to do this long term.

Nothing really feels real any more, actions don't feel like they have consequences, and sometimes I have to deliberately think to myself that I'm really here in this moment, because it feels like I'm watching a memory. I want all the help I can get, I even tried to get admitted to hospital, but nobody has the time to care.

This is actually really upsetting to talk about because so many times people got so close only to be rejected with no actually reasoning and just fear mongering and red scare propaganda.

It touches government corruption and refusing to do whats best for voting points which is something we unforturntually still see today. I am not trying to make this all a joke I just believe in life if you cant laugh and have fun about really dark subjects life is stupid. 



That being said welcome to my past American health care thingy: 


A Brief History: Universal Health Care Efforts in the US.” PNHP, https://pnhp.org/a-brief-history-universal-health-care-efforts-in-the-us/.  

the entire history of american health care

no real reforms happened until 1901 with fdr who was one of the first presidents to believe no country could be strong with everyone being poor and sick. granted he didnt do anything about it because he was busy doing welfare and stuff but still. 

this entire thing got turned around when ww1 came around and the anti german propaganda and calling everything they didnt like socialist started. (wow really?? not like america does that every time we go into a war) 

so health care just got called communist until alot later because of germany than the soviet union (neither of which were communist rather state capitalist but i digress) 

this really only changed when truman came into president and basically was like ya communism is bad but you know whats also bad??? people dying of easily prevented illnesses because they cant afford it. 

SUPRISE SUPRISE

mr. cold war truman was accused of being... WAIT FOR IT. A SOCIALIST *the audience gasps* by the republicans no less *audience gasps even more* *sheds a single tear* 

the ama claimed healthcare would make doctors slaves.  

Segregation of races didn’t end for another 20 years when this was going on by the way (legal segregation I mean)

(If you cant tell I am very left wing)

The republicans at the time spent the most money they have ever spent on lobbying 1.5 MILLION to keep healthcare not happened. In todays money that’s over 28 MILLION DOLLARS. 
The average person spends 4 million dollars over the course of their entire life. To put it in perspective. 

 They paid off members to not support healthcare. 



Lets take a step back and go over groups that were for medical care for all. 

In 1926 a bunch of fility rich people met together, called themselves the ccmc and were like yea healthcare cool. 

They made 26 research volumes and 15 smaller reports over a 5  year periods.

That’s a lot. 

They gave congress the evidence of why it would be good for everyone for the government to nationalize healthcare and you can guess what the government calls it- SOCIALIST. 


Henry sigerist: from the 1930s to the 1940s he played a major role in the politics revoling around medicine and healthcare. He  believed in a compulsory health insurance. Some of his students even went on to follow in his footsteps and become big in the same industry. 

While I do not agree in compulsory anything this was a big step due to Sigerist teaching at John Hopkins which of course is a very pretitous school. 


The famed wagner bill was released into public light in 1943. It supported national health survice and was put into light by people who this bill would help. 

Progressive leaning farmers, Organized labor groups, liberal physicians. People coming from every walk of life to achieve a common goal that they all were affected by which is really beautiful if you think about it. 



Lets look further into why it kept being declined over and over again. Why socialism and communism were trigger words and why the American people were so scared they really listened to them. 

America was one of the super powers of the world. It still is but even more so during the 20th century. 

Families would send their fathers and sons and young as 18 to war against these dictatorships all that started with false promises.

Promises of equality and promises of protection. In Germany that led to the holocaust as we all know. In the soviet union it led to the oppression and execution of hundreds of thousands of people. 

Both the USSR and Germany are currently described as a State Capitalist system where the government controls the means of production. 

The government painted both of these as socialist so of course every person who watched their childhood friends, sons, brothers, etc etc be sent off to war to die at the hands of these evil people would want the opposite of that.



Finally in 1965 johnson signed Medicaid into law. Starting the healthcare thing for once and for all.

Yeah, I don't know what to write, honestly.
I'm just really depressed today. Probably not in the state to write anything decent. 
Not that it matters, since I already wrote my suicide note about 2 weeks ago anyway, so my close friends'll be fine.  
And it still stands. I... don't know how I'll be able to continue on.

Some brief backstory I guess: 
I moved to the US almost 2 years ago. 
I have a history of countless suicide attempts (I lost track how many), but haven't attempted since moving here. 
After moving here, I was staying at someone's place.. let's say, a friend's place. 
Well... that ended. 
So I've been homeless for over 3 months now, and it's... SO FUCKING MISERABLE. 
So cold. So hungry. So lonely....

That loneliness in particular is just... ugh. 
I don't have any friends here near me, so I'm very starved on social interactions. 
It may sound silly, but I'm also VERY starved as far as... touch goes. 
Turning 21 soon, but I'm still a virgin. haha
And it's like.. I look good (I'm female, btw). 
But I have SUCH, SUCH bad social anxiety and I just can't deal with it. 
I'm too shy, too awkward to interact with people in *any* context at all. 
I hate it.
I don't hate myself for being autistic anymore, but I struggle with socializing a lot and it's very difficult.

The only time I'm not insanely anxious is when I use. But continous substance use is not sustainable... hell, I'm poor as fuck, lol.

"Please help me figure out how to leave a psychologically, verbally, and slightly physically abusive situation that has been going on since I was 11 years old.Reasons I can't leave:

* I can't drive and I don't have a car either.
* I've tried for two years to just get a job, both in my major and minimum wage and escape that way, but it isn't happening.
* I went with another family member and it turned out worse.
* I typically have severe trouble organizing my thoughts well enough to communicate my needs even though I can speak coherent, complex English and I wonder if anybody will even understand this post. I know that I have the ability to take care of myself though, eventually.
* When I was a kid, I started to tell somebody who worked for a social worker and she just talked me out of it by telling me that foster care was worse. But I shouldn't have to be in an abusive situation at all, right?.
* If I try to apply for disability and she knows, I'll have to take even more psychological abuse from her. She would know because she controls the one key to the mailbox
* I can't find any resources to escape specifically for adult male (or even adult) children still psychologically abused by parents.
* The things that I go through are minimized by other people's stories.
* It took a psychiatrist who has thirty years of international experience just to start getting a clue of what type of person my mother really is. My mother is like a virus that keeps trying to turn me against my psychiatrist to where I'll have nobody on my side at all. I've had trouble communicating issues to my psychiatrist because of multiple factors: my trouble communicating, my mother sitting in the next room.
* She once made a lie that I shoved her that sent me to jail for 10 minutes, but I was never prosecuted. There is only an arrest record of just domestic violence (offensive contact). She brags about how she's ""the only one in her family who's never went to jail."" And who would believe me when I'm male and have an arrest record for DV and she's female, the person who got me arrested, and has no arrest record? So I can't press charges because there's a consistent refusal to protect me without physical proof that goes so far beyond what they needed to arrest her and more because they don't do anything about verbal/psychological abuse. Plus, she's slapped me different times before with her palm, but she knew she could do it because slapping doesn't leave a bruise.
* There's a gaping dent in the wall because I ran against it after I got frustrated from being psychologically overpowered.
* She tries to convince people that I'm the problem (aka her male friends who just want to date her, are like her, or will accept anyone because they're feeling lonely). My problem is that I try not to give up. My problem is that I try to fight back even though I lose the war to try to gain my own freedom and peace and when I fight back, she has no limits and will make threats and say anything to retain emotional control of me. She tries to make it seem like I choose this because she says ""Fine, get out."" even though it's unreasonable for someone in a civilized area, like myself to just say 'tonight I sleep on the street to avoid her'.
* She has a health insurance plan tied to my name until I reach the age of 26 this October 2013. In addition, she hasn't given me my copy of the medical/dental insurance cards and I'm not sure when/if she will.
* It seems like when she makes all of these threats that we both know that she can go through with them because she thinks nobody will actually ever defend me or help me escape to a safe environment.

Am I going to be okay? I barely sleep at night. I sleep some during the day and I think it's because I feel safer because I know she's at work. I need to get out. I can barely think.

"Done with lifeNothing has ever gone well in my life, ever. For the 16 years I have been on this earth nothing has ever worked and never have I been truly happy. From girls who don't even want to be my friend, to finding out that I'm only going to be 5'3 (I'm a guy) for the rest of my life, and people constantly harassing me online for no reason. I don't know what to do, nothing seems to improve my situation. I have tried remaining positive but its difficult to when everything you hope would turn out good doesn't. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past but this time I actually feel I might go through with it. I honestly don't know what to do, I feel the only way for me to end this suffering is to commit suicide but I don't have it in me to do that to my parents. I see my 16 years here on this planet as a small preview to how life is going to be for me and so far it doesn't look good and I don't want to live like that. I don't feel I have anything to live for; I only have a couple friends, no girlfriend, I am not athletic or academically gifted, there is no thing I am singularly good at, I'm unattractive and lonely. I don't feel that me living anymore would matter, as I am sure I will not be successful or contribute anything to society If I am older. Its difficult for me to contemplate but I feel suicide is a necessarily thing for me to do.

He makes me feel pretty and wanted, but he isn't here right now. I'm halfway my Social Work study so I know how to self reflect, but I just need someone to talk to.

My SO is the only one who truly loves me, I actually don't have much friends.. just some acquitances (probably spelled wrong?). Normally my self esteem isn't this dependent on my SO, but right now it is.. Dunno why

Long story short, I feel fucking worthless right now. Don't understand me wrong: normally I'm happy with myself, but not today. I miss my boyfriend, and I'm tired of always being the ugly kid. I feel the need to cut myself, although I haven't hurt myself since 2 years.

"Tips for when having your wisdom teeth removed I've just gone through the 4 teeth removal, and although I have little experience to share, I'd thought it would help someone out

The surgery isn't that painful. If you are terrified of needles and knifes and medical stuff, just chill, because it doesn't hurt that much. I'd say a skin acne treatment is more painful..... but it is quite annoying, so don't be afraid of your teeth being handled by professionals, just be aware that it's boring

Idk about the side effects of annesthesy, because for me, nothing silly happened to me at all,,talking about those embarassing braindead confessions due to the side effects maybe it's different where I live idk

The painful part starts after the surgery, so don't worry about the surgery being scary, just appreciate that your mouth is free

Don't suck or spit the blood on your mouth too much, it happens that the cut will bleed and that's the ordinary, just don't mess with your healing process

Sleeping sucks

Eating Ice cream as an excuse for the wisdom teeth removal is the best part

You should brush your teeth, even if it might open the scar a lil bit. Maintain your hygiene

Have a piece of absorbant tissue around, bite it near the surgery area. It'll help to prevent you from doing any damage to it accidentally, like opening your mouth wide, or swallowing too much blood

Schedule your pills treatment

A lot of people seem to be understanding of this but a lot more don't.

"Why I think piracy is necessary You read the title, let me explain. A few days ago Kissanime got shut down by the Japanese Government, and it sparked a discussion around whether or not piracy is or should be acceptable. You can probably guess that I think it is, and I'm putting my thoughts here because I'm not really sure where else to post it and this sub is like a Reddit general board. First point I want to make is how piracy is often the only way to preserve would be lost media. There are plenty of movies, games, music, etc that is impossible to purchase or stream legally, so the only way to use them would be to pirate them and otherwise they would be lost to time! Best example I can think of is the horror film Nosferatu. It's considered a groundbreaking film for the early horror genre, but in 1922 the German Government banned the film due to copyright violation, claiming it was too simular to another movie; Dracula. Nearly every copy was destroyed, but only a few were saved and copied, and now we're able to watch it today because those few copies were copied again and distributed illegally. Also, if you're into anime you know that there are several anime out there that aren't availible through any streaming service so the only way to watch them is to sail the seas. Best example is the series Monster, an adaptation of Naoki Urasawa's manga of the same name. It's considered one if not the greatest mystery/thriller anime of all time, and it's a personal favorite of mine as well. Because it's not on any streaming service and most physical copies are rare and expensive, it would be impossible to watch Monster if it weren't for piracy! Mentioning anime, that leads into my next point which is localization. As you know, during localization of foreign media some details get changed so it can be more accessible to non-natives of where it's from. However, not all of those changes are necessary, and anime is a notible example. English dubs and subs are known to alter the series, in JoJo's Bizzare Adventure music is referenced in character's names and abilites, and the localization team changed them so that they don't get in trouble with copyright. It's become a meme in the community, and for good reason because some of those names are hilarious; ""Flaccid Pancake"", ""Blueford"", ""Filthy Acts At A Reasonable Price"". However, whether or not it's good for the series itself is a different question and pirates translating JoJo themselves are part of why the music references don't go over everyone's head. In other series there's also jokes that are removed in localization because they rely on the Japanese language but are kept in pirated translations, but I don't want to spend too much time on this point and I want to talk about my last argument, which is countries with strict censorship laws. Countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, etc. are known for having strict censors and the vast majority of foreign media isn't allowed through. Pirates are able to translate and distribute it themselves illegally, and as a result the bootleg markets in those countries are huge! But without it, the locals would be unable to access media they wouldn't otherwise be able to enjoy, and more importantly information they didn't know before. Throgh those pirated films, games, and books they are able to learn more about the true nature of their countries' government and other countries' governments as well, and as a result are able to see through propoganda and hopefully get rid of their oppressive leaders. I admit that ""Piracy ---&gt; Revolution"" sounds like a stretch, but that doesn't change how it leads to information that nobody in those countries would know becomes accessible due to pirates. In conclusion, I believe piracy is necessary for the preservation of media. If you're still reading this whole ass essay and you disagree or if I changed your mind let me know, I'd be more than happy to discuss this topic further in the comments",,Normal

I pray someone will kill me one day so I can die without having to commit suicide. these thoughts have increased since I lost the person who was essentially my second father a month ago. I want to be with him. he was one of the only people I felt unconditional and constant love from.

"I've seen a lot of posts regarding transgender individuals so I have a stupid question: why don't we determine a person's gender through scientific tests and assign their appropriate gender at birth? Research has shown that transgender  individuals exhibit variances in genetics and brain structure compared  to their cis counterparts, why don't we determine a person's gender  through scientific tests and assign their appropriate gender at birth?

Studies  have shown that mtf personnel are more likely than cisgender males to  have a longer version of a receptor gene for the sex hormone androgen.   Another study showed that ftm personnel don't have the cyp17 t -34C  allele (which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone).   While these differences in genetics don't definitely conclude if someone  is trans or not, they do serve as an indicator in which more tests  could be done.  Such as observing the structure of the brain, which has  multiple indicators for whether or not a person would experience gender  dysphoria in the future.

Basically,  when a child is born first doctors would do a  assessment of their dna  (which sometimes is done anyways to determine genetic diseases).  If  those results suggested there might be a possibility,  then they would  do further examinations with mri machines and other apparatuses to  confirm their predictions.  I realize that this would probably be costly  (especially in places with sub-par health care) but, this is a  optimistic view of the healthcare system (and some parents have the  resources to have these examinations preformed in the current system,  however neglect to preform them since these assessments aren't very wide  spread).

These examinations could  greatly decrease the amount of gender dysphoria and distress the  individual would have to go through later in life.  On top of that,  treatments could start much earlier, therefore be a bit easier and more  effective.  The person wouldn't have to go through the incorrect puberty  in which their bodies are blasted with the inappropriate hormones for  their gender or deal with years of dysphoria and nervousness.    Furthermore, having scientific procedures being standard would probably  greatly increase acceptance of trans individuals in many societies.",,Anxious

"I finally went to my principal about my history teachers verbal abuse Hello all, I’m currently 14 and in 8th grade, now generally my class can misbehave sometimes but overall, we’re a pretty decent class and calm down when the teacher asks. Throughout the school year I noticed that our history teacher can get pretty verbally aggressive with us, especially when it’s unnecessary and she sometimes targets kids who have done absolutely nothing wrong and it seems ive finally fell under her radar and it was my breaking point and she set me up today which got me in trouble for something pretty damn stupid which was not “charging my chrome book” which i most definitely plugged up and have multiple witnesses to this but she’s 10 times worse with other kids. I won’t mention any names because the kid is seriously going through some stuff but she’s started targeting this student, letting them go to our library to work in there and then call the principal to claim that the student was skipping class, things like that. It’s gotten to the point where the kid will have breakdowns in class and cause physical harm to themselves at home. I finally decided to go to the principal about all of this since I figured yknow, she seems pretty reliable right? I was so wrong. I explained the situation to her through an email since she was so busy all the time and a few hours got the response of essentially “get over it. People get mad.” and now i honestly don’t know what to do, I will purposely try to avoid her class at all points of time and try to escape to the bathroom as much as possible. I broke out in tears when I read the email. Our teachers and staff are supposed to help us feel safe and comfortable and we should be able to go to them about these things but now I’m afraid to step into my history class because who knows when she could have an outburst and I, like many students, now feel extremely unheard by the very people who are supposed to help us.

"Please help me. I'm going nowhere in life and I don't want to live like this. This post may not be suitable for this sub, but I posted this on r/depression and r/suicidewatch, but got no comments and didn't show up in new, so I'm posting this in a psychology related subreddit.

Note: this was copied and pasted from my journal i started writing today. English isn't my first language, so please understand some grammar mistakes. I live in an asian country with a education system that grades students relatively, and puts more pressure onto the kids. So it may be different from the us.


A certain illness seems to have consumed me. Depression, anxiety.. I can't exactly describe what is eating me up from the inside, but I feel as if a parasite is slowly eating me alive.

Today was a bad day. I feel a temporary sense of comfort whenever I say the phrase ""today was a bad day"" in my head. It feels like that all the terrible feelings I'm having is just caused by a bad day, and that tomorrow things will be better and everything will come back to place. But it isn't. All my days are bad days. Some are worse than the others.

I had a bad stomachache while I was going to school, and the bus was crowded and everyone was loud. I hate school. I hate every aspect of it. The teachers standing near the entrance checking the kids' uniforms, the posters and screens displaying pretentious videos about college admission, the chairs that are too rigid to sit, the florescent lights that are too bright and cold, the constantly shifting schedule, the teachers who don't seem to care about the students yet talk about college admission all the time and pressure kids to choose a major and a future job and plan out their whole career at 16. The kids that are too loud. Everyone is too loud. Everything is too loud.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be reincarnated into another person's body without my memory fully wiped. I feel like I'm living in another person's body. The only time I can feel truly myself is on the internet. I started a discord server a few days ago. Everyone was great, yet I felt miserable. I felt as if I was tricking them into thinking I was a smart and funny person. I haven't felt this in a while, and I cling onto that sense of self worth and belonging I can never get in real life. 

In real life, in school, in hagwon, it's different. I am still that star trek obsessed kid who thinks too much and tells weird jokes, but nobody knows be. Nobody knows who I am. Even my mom, my teachers, the kids in my school, nobody knows me. I can never talk about things I love in real life. I can't talk about html and building my own website with anyone, I can't talk about star trek or memes, I can't discuss philosophy or talk about how school sucks and how bad my day was. I feel like nobody gets me offline. I don't feel accepted. I feel like I'm the permanent new kid in my life.

I'm not seen as a smart kid anymore. When I was younger I was the gifted kid that always got stuff right, knew more stuff than the textbook, the kid who was always correcting the teacher, the kid who everyone asked things they didn't know. I was the kid whose teacher, when they called their parents, always told them how their kid was a bright and gifted kid. Everyone had high expectations for me, but now I'm disappointing everyone with my dropping grades and depression.

Tbh, I feel like I'm tricking everyone who views me as a smart person. I feel like an imposter who everyone mistook as the gifted kid when I was younger. I feel like I'm one of the the r/iamverysmart people who insecure with their intelligence. I feel like my whole childhood was a lie. 

Now people who don't know me well think I'm 'average"". Worse, they see me as a lazy, creepy kid who forgets everything, doesn't understand social cues and eats lunch alone. I feel as if there is an underlying, constant ""rage"" about myself and everyone in my life. The ""rage"" sometimes makes me want to kill myself, or worse, kill everyone in my school. I feel like a terrible person, a being who can't be even described as ""human"" when I find myself imagining blowing up my school with a bomb. That ""rage"" seems to come from my insecurity. I feel so insecure sometimes that it turns into a full blown panic attack like I would never feel happy again, like every inch of hope has been sucked out from me. 

I'm confused about my dreams and major too. One day I want to be a programmer/developer, one day I want to be a professor in philosophy/history/neuroscience/astronomy, one day I just want to earn a living and be on the internet and game all day, one day I want to be a writer, one day I just want to fucking kill myself. My teachers pressure kids to choose their future jobs/major quickly. They are always doing activities that involve kids to write down their future majors and careers. I can't be honest with anyone, sometimes myself too. I feel like that ruined my whole dreaming thing beginning in 2018. I stopped to think about my possibilities and stopped being honest with myself and always thought that I was too late and wasn't qualified.

Sometimes I have the sudden urge to get my shit together and do something with this life. Then after a day when I find myself forgetting an assignment or procrastinating, I feel as if I can't never get my shit together and fall back into that viscous cycle again. This has happened to much to me that it sucked away the hope and made me thing I was going to be doomed forever.

"used to be successful, now suck ass, not feeling so greati've been depressed off and on for most of my life since i was a a kid.  sixteen or so.  maybe a few years younger.  it got bad in my twenties with my first office job and then grad school, and all the poverty.  the paycheck-to-paycheck.  i hope this doesn't make me sound spoiled, but i'd never had to cope with actual hunger.  i came from a nearly featureless middle-upper-class family and i had never lived anywhere dangerous or unheated or etc.  

shit, getting away from the point.  i was really down then, i'm trying to say.  i came close to suicide on several occasions and i thought about so often it was like my fucking sidecar.  

but i got through it.  after grad school i wrote a book, and it was a good book, and it sold, and it did well, and for the first time ever i felt like a success, like i had proven people wrong about me.  that i was ok after all.

it was fucking unreal.

but then things just kept getting worse.

i sold two more books, and they were reviewed well---i know:  how can i complain, right?  i'm a shithead, right?---but sold like crap.

and my career started fading.

i had been a young hotshot and i became a lukewarm journeyman and now i'm kind of nothing.

i've lost my talent.  i can't write more than two fucking sentences.  which means i don't get paid.  

and i've been losing more and more money every year.

even worse:  i'm basically afraid to write.  something that had once been inside me, some kind of spark that was at once given to me and also a part of me, was just gone.  

my agent's gone cold on me---for good reason----and every day i sit with the computer on my lap all day and just commit one act of cowardice after another:

i look at porn.

i watch netflix.

i follow auctions on ebay on which i have no intention of bidding.

saving ""favorite houses"" on zillow that i have no way of buying.

i'm turning into a fucking wraith.

i think of my younger self, the one who was loved and who wrote bravely and against all hope, when he didn't even know HOW to get an agent, when he dared because he was, well, just BETTER than i am.

and all the book money is almost gone and i just can't get another job and i'm living at a friend's house like a fucking sophomore on summer break.

i checked my dad's shotgun to see if it shells in it, and it didn't.  and i'm still far enough away from actually taking any kind of action that i was able to believe in that as a sign and NOT do anything.

but it keeps feeling closer and closer.

you know that feeling when you're camping and you keep hearing noises in the woods and you can't tell if there's really an animal out there or not?

that's what suicide feels to me right now:

it might be out there, coming in for me right now, me and my tortured pillow and my snot-sweater and my misery, but maybe it isn't.

i can't tell.

i don't like to talk on the phone.  it's kind of a phobia, but if anyone's feeling like some fingerwork, i'd love to hear from you.

"Anonymous confession to the wall.This account has very little attaching to me. I have an actual account. But this post I hope dies.


I'll explain the account name, I have a dark sense of humor, I love cats and I am 22. None of this matters but if you can somehow know who I am, just forget me. I am not worth your time remember.


 I never planned to live this far. My plan was 18. I wanted to take my life for the first time when I was 4. Its my earliest solid memory, not the one I tell people is my earliest memory that one was one that my mother told me about so it just hold well with everyone else. God knows my actual memory is me hitting my head violently against the wall. I hit my head until it bleed once, but I stopped because I feared my mother would be upset that her kid would die. I stopped because regardless of the lack of empathy I feel for myself; I still feel it for others. I just look in the mirror and see some kid who doesn't matter. I could go into why I don't matter but that just seems to be my issue and could get me linked to who I am.


As one might guess I ended up not dying at four my mother was able to get me a little help from someplace that didn't seem to get that I barely spoke after my dad died. They told me to stop keeping my negative emotions to myself or to stop bottling them up as one of them said and rang through the walls through my mothers house every time I wouldn't talk to her.


I tried to help myself but I found it easier to hide those negative emotions because I was still having the good ones sometimes not like the bad ones didn't just wave sign that said ""I'm still here!"" So I got better, I hid those emotions further. I ended up studying other people who seemed to be normal, taking pieces from this person and that person until I made a person so fake that no one knew what I was actually feeling. No one knows or people just think I am just a little ""quirky"" but always so happy and a bundle of joy. No one sees this force that keeps me here or the force that keeps me thinking about ending it the same way each time. 


This part of me that both pulls and pushes me to and from the edge leaves me hanging, because I failed life, I spent my school years educating myself to the point where I was able to go to college around the same time I could first drive for the only reason of living to my families expectations. Until I die I get to keep lying to people to let them have a nice life and not worry about me while I continue pretending to be happy and always wishing that I would just die from a heart attack so didn't look like I killed myself.

I am overweight, I am horrid (that’s what I think at least, but my family tries to be like “oH nO you’re pRetty). Yeah, it’s horrible. I have this friend, I’ll call her Sarah for the sake of this post. Uh, yeah, she’s been.. mean?

Okay, Sarah and I have been friends for over three years. As of now, she’s my best friend. I lost my closest friends awhile back for various reasons, and she’s been my best friend. I love her, she’s amazing. We’ve always had this really close bond, and we’ve always teasingly insulted each other. It was never a toxic thing, but suddenly things are just spiraling in more ways than one. The issue here? She won’t stop commenting about how ugly I am, how fat I am and disgusting I look. She will go on and on about how disgusting I am, how she’s so much skinnier and prettier. God, I swear she’s a narcissist all of the sudden. She’ll compare herself to me all the time and invalidate me and stuff, I hate it so much. She’ll just go so into depth if that makes sense? I’ll just be having a fine time, I’ll feel okay, and suddenly she just starts saying that. It hurts, I’ve told her this, she doesn’t stop. I told her I don’t like it, she said “I don’t know how to respond to that.” Fucking, what? Just say you’ll stop? Oh well, it’s fine but Jesus.. the stuff she says is hurtful, I’m so sick of it. 

I got a job recently, and she won’t stop asking me to buy her expensive items. Yes, we are close friends, but it’s starting to get annoying. She thinks that by talking dirty to me she can get to me; I used to have a crush on her which she was aware about which is why she does it, but not anymore. Currently I am not interested in relationships, so when she does that I get uncomfortable. She’ll be like “you like it when I talk to you like this, don’t you?” I’ll say no, then she’ll say I’m lying. She hasn’t done it enough to the point where I flat out tell her to stop, I’m too much of a pushover and I don’t want to make her angry so I haven’t spoken up.

Let me put it like this: she’s begging me to buy her things which is getting annoying. I will buy her things once in awhile but she needs to stop asking so often, I have a phone bill to pay and stuff and I don’t make much money. It’s getting annoying. She calls me ugly and stuff, she knows it’s hurtful, she won’t stop. These two things top it off, she makes fun of my trauma for one. She hasn’t done it in awhile, 
but god it always leaves me stunned. I went through a lot and confided in her and only her about it, then she makes jokes? This one, she’s done more than once every day this week. I had a sister that passed away, she won’t stop making jokes about her. I’m gonna sound really childish for this, but here goes. My sister died a little after she was born. I never really got to meet her, but it still hurts? I don’t know, I know it sounds stupid but I’m so lonely y’know.. I don’t make many friends outside of the internet and I just think “maybe if she was alive I would have at least someone who accepts me for who I am,” “maybe if she were alive I would have someone there for me,” other things. It just makes me sad, it’s impacted our family a lot. She’s been making jokes about my sister, and it makes me so angry. I got angry with her one time about it, and she said I was dumb for feeling bad. “Why are you being so defensive about someone you’ve never met?” Something like that. It just.. hurts.

God, I’m so hurt. I don’t want her to act like this, I want things to go back to normal. I don’t want to drop her, I don’t want to be alone, I don’t have anyone else, but still.. I don’t want to spend all this time feeling constantly angry with her y’know? I don’t know what to do, I can’t confront her cause she won’t take it seriously, she just never does. The last time I confronted her about something she just kept responding with “I know” or something. What do I do? I really don’t want to lose her but this hurts. Someone give me advice, please? Ugh, I’m sorry if I sound dumb or desperate but.. I am. Also, I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Thanks.",,Depressed

"Have you ever met a boy who makes you angry without even opening his mouth? I have.

I had to sit next to him every day until quarantine started.

(sorry if this is formatted weird, I’m new to Reddit &amp; on my phone)

Where a normal person would have a heart, a soul, or a brain, this absolute fingernail of a human person had Marvel and DC. He simply could NOT comprehend the fact that some people like things OTHER than Marvel and DC. He couldn’t wrap his dusty twig of a brain around the fact that different people have different interests!

My friend would bring up JJBA, and this rabid incel would scoff—his nose buried in a half built lego batmobile—before calling the entire show worthless sh*t.

My poor friend would look away before sullenly responding something about how it has a lot of flaws, but he still loves it so much! Barf-for-brains doesn’t care, he has his opinion.

I was talking to this friend about my favorite game—Skyward Sword! I had *barely* started my sentence, i think i just said, like, “I’ve been replaying Skyward Sword and I’m so happy about it—“ 

GUESS WHAT

lord supreme, ruler of all things and the most knowledgeable of all media has an opinion that i simply MUST hear (even though i have not addressed him)

No, hangnail, i don’t care that you think Skyward Sword is the worst zelda game

Because i never asked

and because i was VERY clearly talking about how much i like the game with someone. else.

My friend brought up how she was happy that Billie Eilish won some music award to me and a couple of other people. 

He stands up, walks to our table, and then says “she didn’t deserve the award”

SERIOUSLY when did i ask?? when did i kneel at your feet—BEGGING for your hot takes on the current music industry??

This is the kid who told be that Marvel soundtracks were the epitome of music.

He told me. The Instrumental Music major. Who has been in several different orchestras and performed in several different shows, created my own music, and appreciated different musical artists from around the world. That MARVEL soundtracks were all that and a bag of chips. 

I have to laugh.

I think he brought that up while I was talking to my friend about how much I love Joe Hisaishi and i said something along the lines of “this man is a musical genius” or “Hisaishi has made some of the best music of the current era”

Good lord it was exhausting being around his inflated ego first thing in the morning every day.

"the unknowns about what happens ""after""I want to be convinced that suicide will bring resolution but for me, resolution specifically means an end to all awareness and being. I want no signs that I have ever existed. But, my fear is that there is, in fact, an afterlife where we continue ""existing"" in perpetuity or worse yet, we end up reincarnating back into the physical world we thought we had just left behind. 

Frieda Kahlo had said something to the effect that it would be a horror to die only to find yourself reincarnating back into the same existence. 

Not that I'm religious but I do understand that there is a possibility that some religious explanations of the afterlife are accurate. Then there's actual accounts of individuals who have experienced minutes of clinical death and reported either lights or just an overall feeling of peace accompanied by absence of feeling. 

A peaceful existence independent of feeling is not really what I want. I just want the lights to go out. The fact that we have no way of knowing what we're signing up for with a big decision as suicide is very frustrating. How do the rest of you reconcile with the fact that there are no guarantees that come with death?",,Depressed

TRIGGER WARNING: depression, self harm
I originally posted on r/advice but I need answers ASAP




okay, I’ll try to make this as short as possible

so basically, my life is going downhill. all of my friends have left me, I can’t keep a single relationship with anyone. I’m beginning to feel burned out in school for the first time, and my grades and quality of my assignments are slowly dropping

for context, I’ve been self harming since I was 13, I’m 17 now. I’ve been clean for about 6 months, but I can barely resist the urge to do it anymore. I can’t even think of what’s stopping me. I have lied to all of my psychiatrists and therapists, telling them i’ve never had suicidal thoughts or hurt myself in anyway. I also haven’t been in therapy for 7 months. The only person close to me is my best friend, she knew I was self harming from the beginning. My parents don’t even know. they know I struggle with anxiety and depression, but they don’t know about the self harm. I’ve been expressing interest in going into inpatient recently (only to my friend) and she said she thinks it would be very good for me. 

i’ll tell you about my relationship with my mom for context. She’s VERY emotional, and I’m very closed off. She gets upset a lot of the time because I don’t like her touching or hugging or kissing me. we used to fight a lot about me not going to school but I think it’s a little better now that i’m homeschooled. 

today was a good day. I had a lot of fun hanging out with my sister and mom, but now that I’m in my room, I feel horrible. I feel it all crashing down. I really just want to go downstairs and hug my mom and cry and tell her everything and convince her to put me into outpatient, but I’m too scared. I’ve never felt like wanting to tell her about this and I probably won’t ever feel like this again

"I know many of you are going to look at this and ignore it but still gonna say it. The band All Time Low is hella good.

Their songs speak for me and have gotten me through so much shit these past few months. Without them and some other bands I'd prolly be miserable as all hell right now. So I want to thank the bands that have said what I've been too afraid to say and said my words that I've thought all my life.

I know they will never see this as it's a sub for teenagers, but thank you to Simple Plan, LINKIN PARK, skillet, and most importantly All Time Low. 

If y'all are struggling and holding stuff in like I do look up those bands and just listen to the words they are saying 

The top songs I would recommend are: 

Take my Hand - Simple Plan 

Me Against the World - Simple Plan

Last one Standing - Simple Plan

Finish Line - Skillet

Monster - Skillet

Breaking a Habit - LINKIN PARK 

Therapy - ATL (All Time Low)

Kids in the Dark - ATL

Weightless - ATL

Good Times - ATL

And the all time best in my opinion, Monsters - ATL (for best sound the acoustic version or the Feat. Black bear only version is the best, they have one fearing a female artist I cannot currently think of and it's good, just not as good.)

You can pretty much pick any song from these bands and they have something meaningful to say. There are many more songs that have helped me. 

*just to say it. I have yet to come across a song called ""monster"" or ""monsters"" that was bad, hell every song with those titles has been amazing.

To those who read this, thank you for giving a minute or two, I highly recommend those bands, especially ATL. Live your best life friends!",,Anxious

"Y'know what I wish?I wish I was lovable. Not cute or charming or confident sort of lovable. Getting dates and meeting people is the easy part it's the price to really love me that is a killer 

Now mind you I speak generally when I speak of love, whether it be romantic or platonic 

To love someone is to understand them, and to understand them is to meet their demons, flaws, and, burdens and look past them, accept them, and be happy to be with them as companion or lover. The price of knowing, so to speak.

The problem is my price tag far exceeds my value. The inside walls of every human being's world are bleak, agonizing, complex and sorrowful. 

But I tend to find myself bleaker than most, that or incredibly uncaptivating to many others. 

It's always either I have too much baggage to front or generally ignorable. I suppose that is why I have fell into my social niche as the Jester/ Pseudo-Guru that entertains many skin deep commrades and friends today 

The type who always has a good story, can make witty banter, and is just complex enough to say tomes of cryptic advice with the little wisdom I've gathered in my short life. Easy to hang around, seemingly confident, supportive, and seemingly sharp with no price. Something everyone wants 

To most it's like I've dropped out of sky to hang out with them. My life has no details besides the generals and even those are skewed. 

People hate baggage, I'm all baggage, 96-98% tops. Maybe it's not talking about it that has lead it to fester into such a repugnant pit in my life but it's selfish to make another bare my bleak bleak world and my greivances that they would much rather ignore

"I want you.Dear you,

I want you. That isn't that hard to believe, especially since we've been together for 11 months. I want you even though we have an ocean in the middle of our relationship. I want you even though right now I have no job despite the fact I graduated at the top of my class with honors. I want you even though my family is poor. I want you even though I've given up every last penny I had to live with you... and now that I'm tapped out I don't know how to get to you again.

I want you even when you're mad at me, like I know you are now. I want you even though I know what I did isn't even that bad, even though you are making me say sorry a thousand times... simply because I put a return receipt in an email because I wanted to make sure you read it. I want you even though you blew up and didn't even respond to what that letter said.

I want you even though I think sometimes you are completely careless with my feelings because deep down I know in my heart that you are capable of loving me. I want you even though you don't say you want me anymore... even though you used to say it all the time... even thoug,h when I ask you if you still love me, you secretly kind of sigh when you say yes, like I should know. 

I want you right this minute when you are over three thousand miles away and giving me a silent treatment leaving me no way to get a hold of you. I want you because I'm capable of forgiveness almost every time and I know your life hasn't been easy either and I have this thing for broken people because I am one too. 

I want you because right now even though I am incredibly afraid that you are going to break up with me, I somehow still have no regrets about losing my virginity to you. There is something about the life within you that makes me feel so incredibly alive that it makes me feel like I am standing on the highest peak and letting the wind whip my face and for the first time I feel alive.

I want you even though when I got depressed, as I tend to do sometimes, you started comparing me to your ex and suddenly I felt like I was forever in a box that I had to climb out of. On the brightside, right now I want to slice myself into a million ribbons, but I'm not because I promised you that day I'd never do it again. I want you because after 10 years of hurting myself you forced me to stop... but right now it is so so very hard.

I want you to see that everything I do, even the things you get frustrated about or get angry about me for... are only because I love you. I want you because I just keep hoping you'll talk to me, that you'll stop focusing on the wrong part of my last letter and start paying attention to what it said, that I just need to be told I'm loved even if I'm supposed to already know.

I want you.

I want you to talk to me. 

I want you to forgive me.

I want you to be happy.

I want you to want me.

That's all I've ever wanted from you.

Love,

Me.

I went inside and the sick feeling went away and tears started pricking in my eyes. I was scared to get a haircut!

"someone please give me a reason to stay aliveive been spiraling recently. i dont see much in my future anymore. im 19, but i think ill have to drop out of college soon because of my dads cancer. or ill have to enroll in a community college, i dont know yet. im giving myself til january to decide.

i feel so done. having covid in october fucked me up so bad. it had such a huge toll on me that just hearing a cough (and oh.. do my parents cough) makes me tear up. ive been enjoying the time i have alone because i dont have to hear anyone and its just me. 

i feel like its over for me. i dont know if ill actually attempt, but i just wish things could change. as of right now, things arent looking very good for my family, and it will get worse. its so difficult going my day to day knowing it hasnt even gotten to the worst part yet. its like every day im getting closer to the climax of the story - my dad passing. then after that, i dont know what ill do. i really dont. 

my childhood insurance is expiring in 2021 when i turn 20. i live in a red state, so there really isnt much for me in terms of mental health help. ive looked, trust me. even my buddy says the psych hospitals suck. i dont see a way out.

i just wish i was like the other 19 year olds. i wish i didnt have to have these worries. i wish i could have had a normal transition to adulthood.

i wanna be a teacher, but i did some googling, and apparently teaching is a really competitive job. so even if i study really hard, theres no guarantee i get the job. then whats the point? ill just be broke? 

does it get better? does it really get better? or is that something people just tell us so we dont kill ourselves? 

my family doesnt speak english so ive been doing all of this myself. fafsa, insurance, appealing claims with said insurance, dealing with our landlord, hospital bills, its so overwhelming, i feel crushed. 

i dont even know what i want. i just wish time would stop.

im rambling. ill stop.",,Depressed

Just wishing I was dead. Like every other day.Suicide is on my mind nearly every moment it seems. So yes I've posted here before. Losing the only person I've ever loved has sent me spiraling. 3 years wasted almost 9 months ago and it's not getting any easier. Getting old with nothing to show for it. The usual. All I do is go to school and sit at home alone. School is the only thing keeping me going. I'm older than most of my classmates so no real opportunities for friendship or relationships there. I figure I'll get my degree then do the deed so at least I'll have accomplished something before I pass. By the time I'm what mid thirties still alone whats the point. I'd rather die than grow old on my own thats too bleak.,,Depressed

I've dropped out of uni once, now it's almost like I'm at it again.        
I want to figure out a major that I like but it seems like I can't.       
Everything I'm interested in is considered a ""useless degree"" by today's society.       
I hate how living works in the modern era.            
I don't understand why things are like this.          
I've been such a disappointment to my parents, I've already done so well in high school after all. Things just fell apart after that.        
I don't want to work without a degree either, I'm interested in doing college but I don't know what to pursue. Time is ticking. I don't know what to do.            
There are no community colleges here, taking a major means that'll become your major for life, switching majors here will result in taking the usual 4-year bachelor's program all over again.         
I hate this. I'm not fit for adulthood in today's society. I've been such a letdown, and that's a fact.",,Depressed

"To all my friends at SWI just wanted to take a second before I start drinking for real (I have taken 2 sips already) to say thank you and to say that even when I've been at my lowest and down on the ground, you have taken the time to post kind words and challenge my thinking. The latter is sometimes hard for me to do, but being an Anorexic, I know all about challenging yourself and others to think ""outside the box"" almost...to change your perspective on things to see if that doesn't help you think differently. That is what we did on the Eating Disorder Message Board that I used to be a part of a while ago. I was forced to leave because it is ONLY for recovery and I am not even close to that, and I haven't been for a long time. I am still deep in my ED, still actively restricting/purging (though NEVER binging) and I am suicidal more often than not, so I am excluded from posting until I am more recovery-minded. That is just how the rules are and I am OK with that.

I have my Manischewitz Concord Grape Wine here by me and I am getting pleasantly toasted. I can't get TOO drunk because my hubby has to go to work later and I have to be home with the kids, but I can drink until I feel happy. Please don't lecture me on alcohol and my meds (meh...haven't taken them today...I KNOW I KNOW...don't say it!) or that self-medicating is not the way to go. It is the only way I can feel better right now and it is legal. Now what I have planned for later is definitely NOT legal, but I don't care much. It is not like I will be out on the streets tokin'...my neighbor has a bowl and I've been invited over later for some fun while her daughter sits with the kids over at my house. I rolled my own joint a week or so ago (failed at it dammit...I am out of practice) and smoked it on my back roof that is right underneath our bedroom window. I got high and I felt better. I am self-medicating, self-harming in a way, and escaping this prison that is my mind.

But...I digress. Thank you to everyone here. I appreciate you and I am not in a really bad place at the moment...just depressed. I still think of suicide a lot, but right now, I don't feel moved to do anything of the sort. I don't want to...I am already feeling the effects of the alcohol and I feel...okay now.

I can’t keep doing this. Every single day I’m told that I did something else wrong. I walk on eggshells and I try to be a good person. It’s never enough and I’m so tired.Every time I ever try to talk to my boyfriend about anything he yells at me for how I feel. But he yells at me when I don’t share my emotions with him. There are things recently that he’s done that really bother me. I’ve tried to talk to him about it and it gets twisted that it’s my fault or I deserve it. “How else am I supposed to act when I have to be with someone like you?” I never beg him to stay. Unfortunately I’m not strong enough to leave. He threatens me and blackmails me when I’ve tried in the past. I try to stay neutral and just go along with what he says to avoid a fight. He yells at me for that. When I apologize he doesn’t like how I did it. I do some nice gesture for him to make up for being so awful. He complains about the gift or whatever I did. He came over tonight and he walked right past me. I said hello and for nothing back. I gave it a few minutes and tried to kiss him. Nothing. As I started walking away (didn’t say anything or do anything) he yelled at me saying I was an asshole. He demands I kiss him then. I ask him why he didn’t want to kiss me before? I start to walk up to him and he pushes me away. I have to sleep on the couch while he gets the bed to himself now. I’m not going to argue but I have work in the morning. I’m so far past my limit. There’s other issues at hand that have nothing to do with him that also contribute to my worthlessness but this is in the forefront right now. I’m so tired.,,Depressed
"If your reading this, then I finally did it.This is about how I feel right now.
Tired of it all... every day... so..

If you're reading this

Then I finally did it

I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye

There was no time

Understand I was stressed

Living day to day was hard

And I gave it my best

But there was nothing left

For me in this world

To convince me to stay

Now I'm long gone away

Don't you do that

Don't you start your tears

Just remember all the time we spent over the years

Never cry

Never think bad to me

What's done is done and that's the way it had to be

I need you to be strong for me

Say your prayer everyday in my memory

I'm sure it's helping me

To earn my feathers

To get some wings

And a halo and a harp and angelic things

And even though I'm gone And outta sight

Never worry about me

I'm alright

"I feel like it won't get betterI've been struggling with depression for a solid few years now, but the past few months have been the worst of my life. Me and my first serious girlfriend broke up in January for a lot of complicated reasons, and I was okay for a while, but then I learned in March that she had gotten drunk with my best friends and they had all had sex with each other. I broke down that night harder than I ever thought was possible. I still loved her, and was just barely starting to get over her, and now I'm stuck in a cycle of missing her and wondering what I could've done better to avoid this. She doesn't seem guilty at all. They still all hang out together, and they all abandoned me without a second thought. I feel like I'm worthless. I have no other friends in my physical life. My internet friends are the only people to throw their arms around me lately, and my family I guess. It's been a month or so since I learned, and I still feel like shit. I don't sleep because I just dream about her, and when I lay down I only think about them doing it. I don't eat anymore. I don't feel hungry. I take a lot of advil to make me tired enough to pass out, or awake enough to play games or something to take my mind off of it. I usually have a breakdown every morning, and find myself crying and holding myself in a corner. I've had the noose around my ceiling fan a lot, but I can never convince myself to do it. I just feel so tired and empty. Everyday is the same routine of misery and feeling sad, and I hate waking up. I don't want to live my life anymore and I don't know how to deal with it.

Anytime I try to tell anyone about any of this, they usually pass it off as attention wanting or feel like I'd never really do it, but I'm struggling a lot. I keep writing suicide notes and getting really close to doing it, but I never can commit. I don't know what to do anymore.",,Depressed

The only reason I haven’t just ended things yet is because I know it would break my parents hearts.  I’m just not so sure that that’s enough for me to keep suffering through this hell I’ve created for myself.

"Here we go againI'm 41. Single day of 2 amazing kids, 6 and 5. I have them with me after the divorce. Thats the only reason why I'm not dead. 

Ive been depressed for years. In and out of counseling. I have PTSD (not combat related). During this time of year, and I think its because of the trauma of the breakup of my marriage, I absolutely lose it. This is the 2nd year its happened. I begin to not be able to make it to work. I get the kids up and off to school, get ready, and drive there. Sometimes I just cant make it inside or if I do I cant stay all day. I was out last year for almost 2 months straight. So of course, I'll have no money to compound my issues. Today is one of those days where I cant make it inside. 

When I woke up I was tired and angry. My sweet little girl didn't want to put on jeans. So I flipped my shit and yelled when I should have just got her the pants she wanted. I felt like such a piece of shit. I talked to her after and she was okay, but I basically woke her up and made her cry and now I'm going to have to deal with weighing on me. She didnt deserve it.

I try really hard but I just get so angry. Their mom is supposed to have the kids. On paper I get weekwnds only. But she chose to be with a child (20 when she is 38) over her own kids. Of course, I take the kids and I need them because they keep me alive. But she offers no help. Just a hard way to go. When my brain breaks down she wont help with the kids. And it makes me so angry. I try so hard. I'm taking her to court for child support and some accountability, but its so long and drawn out. I'm out of money and the lawyer is not really doing all he can. 

I know I'm rambling. Im sorry. I realize there are people here who will end it all, and honestly I'm not going to. But I want to. I want to just be gone. Just to not have to feel the pain. But theres some joy in life. Kids smiles mainly. Lile I said, they are the only thing keeping me alive.  I have a great family and a wonderful girlfriend. I'm just lost. So very lost. Id be okay with going in my sleep. Or a car crash. Something explainable. Something so the kids can say, ""Daddy didn't kill himself."" But the honest truth is I'm almost 41. Ive screwed my brain up with drugs in my youth. This all seems to be my fault, and I really just want to go.

And I know this is gonna sound like esoteric bullshit, but I really think I have something influencing my thoughts that is not of this world.

"Third time posting here, Theres a pretty good chance i go through with it this timeIm 18, male, starting to finish up my first semester of college, what are supposed to be the ""best years of my life"", but i think it might finally send me over the edge. I have always been a strange kid I guess. I always had only one or two friends i really trusted and everyone else just kind of tolerated me. But now ever since high school my ""friends"" have always given me shit. Everytime i post people tell me they are not real friends and i will find some eventually, but i have come to the realization that i have never made a single friend in my life. I cant just leave the friends that I have because then i will have no one. The people I hang out with at school are all friends of my roommates and none actually care about me and i do not have the ability to make new friends no matter how hard i try. Im also away from my family, which doesent even matter because the only member of my family who would give a shit if im gone is my little brother who is only 7. He will forget about me before he is even a teenager. 

For a while I was able to distract myself with hobbies but I have come to another realization that I totally suck at everything I like, and believe me ive tried to get better, I have definitely put in the effort, and i am still easily outclassed by beginners. Everything i am naturally good at, I hate. I am naturally good in school, but i am doing everything I can to finish as fast as possible, and I am really good at video games which I have quit entirely to try to improve my life, to no avail.

I have been lonely for so long, the first time girl showed interest in me was this summer. I fucked that up by being too clingy and weird because i was so desperate for the attention. Since then I think I have spoken to one girl once and I fucked that up as well and she has not spoken to me since. I just can't help but feel completely alone in this world, which just makes me feel even more like shit that i can't become friends with a single person in a world filled with so many different people


I have exhausted all my effort but i am still a friendless piece of shit who sucks at everything he does. Every other time i posted here i had almost no intentions of killing myself, but this time i feel entirely different. The thought just wont leave my head. Things just wont get better. I have not thought about how im going to do it yet, but im sure ill come up with something. I just wish i could apologize to my family for being such a burden before and after my death. ",,Depressed

"I was groomed by a man I met on here and would appreciate some support I met him on Reddit (not r/teenagers) when I asked for advice on depression and loneliness. He supported me, spoke like he truly understood me, listened when I needed to vent about family and friends, and congratulated me on my achievements. He was the only person in my life who I was open to. 

But it was all wrong. He was 25, and I was 14. He would subtly bring sex into the conversation. Like asking about masturbation and porn, and how my body looked. At first I just thought he was asking to get a better understanding of me so to better help me. But no, he seduced (more like emotionally coerced) me into cybersex. 

I kept talking to him for months because he was the only one I could get support from. I’m afraid of people blaming me for talking to him in the first place and continuing with the cybersex, but you need to experience the loneliness, isolation, and depression that I did to understand. 

I’m trying to move on. I’m afraid of him possibly not reacting well with me when I stop responding. I know it’s unlikely he would hurt me in person but I still fear it. That’s why I’ve been screen recording and taking screenshots of evidence and storing it in a flash drive just in case. 

I guess I’m just looking for support. I can’t get it from my therapist or parents because I can’t have them knowing, which is why I keep making posts here.",,Anxious

"When I lost my mindI have created a throw-away account just so I don't get tarnished on my other one. I'm a frequent visitor here although it has been a while since I last visited. 


I think I've lost my mind. Now I truly know the meaning of the word. Genuinely, I think my mind is now lost forever. I used to be suicidal. I wouldn't do too much. But I was attempting mildly about once every few months. I have minimal scarring due to my method of choice.

Anyways, about 9 months ago something deep within me clicked. Suddenly, I was happy and active. I was diagnosed Bi-Polar. I was working around until 3 am every night. I was working one full time job, part time classes, and I was doing extra-curricular work all the time. I was extremely happy, but in an unhealthy way.

After about 3 months of super energized bliss, the light didn't shut off.. it kind of... burned low. Now, like an ember in a bulb, it radiates a general content with life. What some people might call ""happy"". However, along with it is the ashes of my previous depression. 20 long years of constant suicidal thoughts perverted my mind. I was a sociopath by many accounts. Though sensibly ethical and occasionally expressive, I was always subtly empty. That emptiness carried over after my sudden bout of happiness. Now, I'm content, but empty...

I feel like a shell. I have goals and aspirations now. I have dreams and hopes. But I can't *feel* anything. Its like instead of being suicidal and having a deep fulfilling desire for suicide, I'm now just me. Just a sociopath trying his best. 

I don't feel like I'm ""me"" anymore. I feel like a robot. I walk into the office, I make jokes, I talk to friends and family, I'm pursuing other things, but all the while I feel like a robot. Literally...    *emotions DELETED*.  

I guess depression was the one thing that made me feel... human. It was the occasional despair that tied me to this Earth. Now, I feel beyond it. If I was fired today, I would feel nothing. If someone hated me deeply, nothing. Now, instead of falling deeper into sadness, I feel nothing. 

It sometimes makes me want to murder or steal. Just to feel that rush of guilt and despair as my life falls apart. But I'm much too ethical to abuse another life just for my own. Sometimes - though - I fantasize about the court room. About the jail time. How I'd ache to be free again, ache for **something**. 

My only driving force is to educate myself further and further until I've conquered the educational world. Until I've learned physics and math to a level that I consider prideful. 

So, essentially, I feel weightless and empty now. Like I'm floating around the world. I have nothing to ground me. Does anyone else feel this way?",,Depressed

My last 2 classes of the day (first is 3 hrs next two are 1 1/2 each) are Algebra and Gov/Econ. Algebra is filled with what I'd call ""preppy girls"" who are nice to look at but shit to talk too since *literally* all of them think people actually care enough about their lives to want to see 30 pics per hour of them sitting in class. Really shows how far the generation has come, right? Anyway I don't want to talk to any of them, except as a non-cool kid I have some desire (as much as I'd consciously disagree with it) to talk to them and make them like me. Gov/Econ is basically the same, but here are some people who I suspect are older, but essentially the same as Alg.

 I’m fighting to see my son, and kinda winning if I’m being completely honest. I barely see him now but it beats what I used to have with him. My family is split on supporting me and not giving a shit. My best friend sided with the part of my family that doesn’t give a shit because she “doesn’t like who I’m becoming” and I “don’t realize what I’m doing and how it’s gonna affect my son”. 
 My girlfriend(kinda, my anxiety and the distance has kept me from officially asking her) lives 2 hours away and tries her best to make me feel better. Baby momma keeps spreading rumors about me, refusing to cooperate even for the sake of our son. 
 I struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal/harmful tendencies for most of my life, and I’ve been almost 5 months clean of hurting myself in any fashion, but lately I’ve had such massive urges to hurt myself that it’s driving me crazy. I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to give up, but everything is hitting so hard, and all the defeats in my head and heart are louder than the victories I’m winning, just feeling really lost and alone.

"How to shave your 🐱 Girls only! I’m probably gonna delete this after a bit soo read it while you can? This is also marked girls only but if your a guy and you read this, you literally don’t gain much from it cus you don’t have a 🐱. 


This is for the girls who don’t know how to shave their you know what, this is genuine advice since I know that when I was a younger teenager I didn’t know how and I had no one to ask so I made many mistakes, lost a lot of blood and now I think I know how to so here’s my advice: 


What you need:

-a razor 🪒 to shave with. You can get a cheap pack of pink ones at the dollar store or those pretty ones with designs from Walmart. Pro tip, use men’s razors for a better and closer shave.

-Scissors ✂️ if you have long hair down there, it needs to be cut before you can shave it or else it will be harder to shave and it will ruin the razor and fill it up with hair and then you need a new razor or you need to clean it which is hard to do. 

-Something to shave with such as shaving cream which you can get from any store but if you don’t have that, you can use stuff like soap foam, body wash, hair conditioner or most oils like coconut or almond.

-Moisturizer for when you are done shaving. Lotion, moisturizer, and most oils work, I personally use lotion with aloe Vera or baby oil but never both as you only need one. 

-Bandaids. Even if you think you did a good job, once you hop out of the shower, blood may start pouring out and then you need paper towels and bandaids to patch yourself up. 

-A mirror which is optional but it really helps when you are new at it because you can actually see what you are doing, after a while you sort of figure it out and can do it without a mirror.  


Where to shave:

-the shower standing but you need to crouch down or lift up your legs and stuff so it can get hard in a cramped shower so maybe a bathtub with a shower in it. 

-in front of a mirror while sitting on a towel or something. This is if you need the mirror, which I suggest if you have not done this before. 


How to shave:

-if the hair is long, cut or trim it down with scissors ✂️. 

-To start shaving, stand up and wet the front area of your 🐱, then apply shaving cream or whatever you are using instead, put it all over the front if you want to shave it all off or only put it where you want to shave the hair. 

-before you start shaving, pull the skin above your 🐱 upwards, this will help shave closer to the root of the hair and won’t hurt because the skin is tightened and it won’t be caught on the razor. 

-Shave in the opposite direction that the hair is growing. If the hair is growing down, shave up, if it’s growing on an angle near your thighs, shave up in an angle. This helps get all the hairs. Do not press hard or press at all, just glide the razor over the hairs, if you press hard or press on it at all you might cut yourself.

-clean off the area you just shaved, if you’re in the shower just wash it off, if you are in front of a mirror, clean it off with a damp paper towel. You might have to put more shaving cream or whatever on and shave again if your hair is thick and didn’t come off the first time. 

-to shave the hair underneath the front of the 🐱, crouch down and sit with your legs out if you in front of a mirror. In other words sit in a way that you can see your whole 🐱 in the mirror. If you are in the shower, sit down the same way, it’s easier than putting your legs up in awkward positions. 

-Apply shaving cream on the lips which are the two sides on either side of where you pee from. 
They are easy to distinguish as they will be covered in hair unlike the middle part which you do not shave because 1 it does not have hair and 2 that would hurt like hell. 

-before shaving either of the lips, pick a side you will shave first and pull the skin above it upwards to tighten it. Then shave in the direction that the hair grows. On the lips it usually grows at an angle so shave towards your thigh but still tilted a bit upwards 

-repeat on the other lip. 

-sometimes hair grows between the folds of your 🐱, in that case, dig around in the folds and check if there is any and if there is, keep the fold open so that you can shave it and go for it, you can do this one without shaving cream which I find easier since you can see the hair better but if it’s a lot, you should use shaving cream. 

You think we are done there, we are not. There is one more part you have to shave. The asshole. Yes the asshole. If you are not aware, hair also grows around the asshole. I heard this story from one girl who didn’t know that until her 30s or some shit and she had sex and everything but her bf didn’t say anything to her until she found out there’s hair there and she shaved it and her bf was like oh you shaved there. So basically it’s really embarrassing if you shave your 🐱 but not your asshole cus it’s like you missed a whole part. 


To shave the asshole:

-You won’t be able to see this in the mirror unless you bend down in front of it and look between your legs into the mirror. But if you crouch down, like when you take a shit in the woods, you can shave it better but you won’t be able to see what you are doing so it’s all just feel and do. 

-put shaving cream all in the crack and around your asshole. If you can’t see, feel where the hair is and glide the razor over the hair and then feel again if the hair is gone or not. 

-you don’t have to pull any skin for this one because ass skin is usually tight until you turn like 35 and it starts sagging really bad. 

-once again do not press down or press hard, especially during this part cus trust me you don’t want cuts on or around your asshole that shit hurts many many decades. And when you think it’s gone or healed over it’s back after you stretch your asshole to take a shit. 


Once you are done shaving everything, clean yourself off and don’t forget to clean yourself off in between shaves so you can get all the shaved hair off and be able to see. If you are in front of a mirror and not in the shower, this is a good time to get in the shower and clean off. 


After your shower, get out and dry yourself off, blood may start appearing now so do your best to stop it until after you have applied lotion or oil on the shaved parts and then you can put on bandaids and stuff. 

Yes it’s kind of weird putting bandaids on your privates but no ones gonna see that shit so don’t worry and it’s only to stop the blood so you can take them off a few hours later and clean off the dried blood and it will have stopped bleeding by then. 


I hope this helps someone cus I spent a good 15 minutes wrong to out and ik guys don’t have vaginas but if you wanna shave your asshole, here you go.",,Anxious

"I scheduled my death on August 03. Now I'm a future chefIf you look at my past posts,  you will know why I had planned my death. I was so tired and hopeless.  Every waking hour was killing me.  So I was really looking forward to my scheduled death.  I was ready.  I was going to do it. I even spent some more time with my friends and even almost made a destructive decision to reveal all of my enemy's secrets that could destroy their whole life.  I mean,  I was going to die anyway,  so fuck being civil.  

But then, for some reason,  I was lured to enrol to a culinary arts school.  I thought of having fun for just last time.  It was hella expensive but I didn't care since I was going to die anyway,  lol. I was there to enjoy my last days.  There was no passion.

But as days past by,  passion started to bloom in me.  I started enjoying this whole thing for real.  I met new friends,  I became dedicated to serve delicious meals,  I had reasons to wake up! 

Now,  I'm still happy and enjoying my trainee days.  So far,  my grades are high and my instructors are already endorsing me.  We will be having our external OJT soon and my name is already known in that hotel,  thanks to the hype caused by my instructors.

I'm more forgiving,  even abandoning my plan to destroy my ex-enemy's secret.  I said 'ex' since there is no more place for hate in my heart. Our life is so precious to focus our heart for someone who will just keep on breaking it.  They were my best of friends who had betrayed me.  They destroyed me.  But I am not going to do the same.  I am now better than that.

"I finally came out to my mother After about 6 years of questioning me sexuality wondering if i was straight, bi, pan, or ace I was finally able to put it all together. I’ve never been the nervous type and I’ve never had an issue expressing my emotions to my mother. She’s made it extremely easy for me as her only child to not lie to her and actually express my emotions without feeling like i’ll be punished or scolded for telling the truth. 

When i was in middle school i first had the thought that i might like boys but later was given a taste of what i thought i liked (by testing the waters with homosexual boy in my school that liked me). I didn’t feel comfortable so i figured that i wasn’t actually bisexual but just going through hormonal bullshit. I asked my mother about it and even said to her that i thought that i was bisexual and at first she was a little shocked but asked me question but was never dismissive. She told me that if it’s truly how i feel and that it’s what i actually want that she’ll support me. I later had a conversation with her and told her what happened and she told me that it’s most likely just me going through changes and that i should define what i am until later in life. 

Going through high school although i dated too many people to count truth be told and was kinda a hoe/ fuckboy i never ventured back to boys. So throughout all of that i felt that i was straight and that there was no question about it until i turned 17. While at the time i was no longer in high school and was on my second year of college i met this transgender girl that i originally was unaware that she was transgender. While alone with her one day things happened and she warned me ahead of time that she had a penis. Although i had never been with someone like her in the past, i didn’t know how to feel about it at but i didn’t feel bugged about it either. I decided i would test it out and i didn’t see a problem with it. 

After that experience i was conflicted and confused on what label i should put on myself. For you see, i’m ace and don’t really care for sex but will participate in it only to pleasure my partner. Now i’m in a situation where I don’t mind what’s down there as long as they are feminine everywhere else and yet i’m also ace. I sat my mother down sparking from a conversation we had about relationships and i finally decided to tell her that i “made up my mind” if you can even say that. 
She sat there stunned for a moment but then smiled at me. Told me that she doesn’t care what i label myself as or who i like as long as i’m happy in the end. 

I don’t think i could ask for a better response or better

We've known each other for about 9 months now and I've known that I liked her for about 4 months. The problem is, I have never been able to figure out how to say it until now. Right now is a very stressful time for me, because this is the first time I have ever made a legitimate attempt to enter a relationship. I'm excited, scared, nervous, and above all, hopeful. I know that it is more than likely it will end in a manner that will at least allow us to still be friends if it goes wrong, but I can't shake the feeling that she'll not only reject me but block me as well.

I have had my identity stolen,every email and major account and cloud violated, and pics stolen and they keep hacking and rooting every phone i get and my laptop is fucked. I have no way to contact the few friends and family i have left, and i only have my older mom, who's getting worse by the day mentally. 

We have no cable, they know our bank, cable, and lots of other personal info, and I feel no matter what, I must give up. 

I am already a mentally ill fucked up person who was just about to get more help, and this is a nightmare. I take responsibility for being wrong and having behaved badly towards some, but they have torn my life apart and ripped my mind to shreds. Im going to have to leave my mom alone and afraid in a place and im so scared, but i gotta kill myself.

"I'm spentTL;DR: I have a hard life - better than many, worse than other - and it doesn't seem to get better. I'm out of hope and am really close to giving up.

To me, my life has always been shit. 

My dad ditched the family when I was five. My mom dated a string of abusive boyfriends - one of them analy and orally raped me when I was 8, then threatened to have his friends rape and murder my entire family while I watched if I told anyone - then she quickly graduated from alcoholism to meth addiction. We were evicted from almost every place we lived in, then my brother and I were taken in by a family we knew from church for about a year until they gave up on us because my mom, who at this point had ditched us to live in Vegas with her methead boyfriend, refused to sign over custody of us to them.

Despite all this, I grew up with hope that somehow I could make my life better. I did terrible in school with a gpa of maybe 1.2 because I missed so many days, never did my homework, and just fucking hated life because I was always hungry, didn't fit in with anyone, and was told all my life how ugly and fat I was because everyone else in my family was rail thin and short while I was tall and built like a linebacker. 

After highschool, I joined the military because it was the only way I could see getting out of poverty. My recruiter was the first person to pretend to believe in me and broke regulation to pay for my adult education classes so I could actually get a high school diploma to join (it was 1999 at the time). 

I actually enjoyed the military and did well. It's wild what 3 meals a day and some actual structure will do for your life. I graduated in the top 10% and went to my first duty assignment overseas. We were at peace then, and things were going really well. I started taking college courses and met the love of my life during carnevale. Then 9/11 happened. 

I deployed first to Iraq in 2003 and saw a lot of shit. I was in a near ambush which wounded many of my pals and killed my best friend at the time. He was driving a humvee, and an RPG struck the dashboard a few inches from the steering wheel. We blew through the killzone across a bridge then turned around to return fire as my 240 was on a mounted stove pipe and severely limited field of fire. When we got back to the rear truck I remember my sergeant calling out his name and then pushing him back from the twisted wheel. His jaw hung free and his tongue looked like a tattered shoelace as his blood poured on the asphalt like water on dry concrete. We never got the guys who did it, and then returned to our FOB where we cleaned out the truck and burned the seats. The whole area smelled of burning JP8 and seared blood. It was fucking nauseating. On top of this, we were hit almost every night with mortars, very few of which got close. I still hear them sometimes when I start to drift off to sleep.

Still, I thought I could do better with my life. I was a specialist at the time and getting close to promotion. I reenlisted to get to a duty station closer to my GF in the states and to get the fuck out of Iraq as quick as I could. I went to Bragg. 

It wasn't bad, at first. I got to see my GF almost every weekend, which was much better than every three months or more when I was overseas. I really thought it was a story book romance, Notebook and shit, and we were doing okay. After three years together, I proposed and she accepted. 

We had to change the date because we got called in to support elections in Afghanistan. We married before I deployed, and it was great. We moved in together in a small town outside Fayetteville and it was really nice. I left, and she started nursing school.

While deployed, I was terrified that I my luck was running out and I wouldn't get back. I was more cautious than I had been in Iraq, especially since I had become a squad leader. In Iraq, I really had just worried about doing only my job right and making sure that I did it well enough with the hopes that everyone else would do there part to make sure we all got back, but now I was worried about making sure all these other shitbirds did their job right and ensure that I brought them all home as well as myself so I could return to my wife.

On one mission, we had intel that there was a high value target we needed to get in this village on top of a hill. When we landed, the shithooks started firing to clear the HLZ and we all dismounted like it was some shit out of We Were Soldiers Once and Young, but it was nothing like that. It was actually really quite. My squad was attached to another company to pull security for their mortars team. I didn't have an ASIP radio because reasons. ICOMS were compromised, so we were prohibited from using those. Point is, I was out there relying on the mortars sergeant to give me the info I needed to know. He didn't.

We had close air support via Blackhawk which circled around the village counter clockwise. The company entered the village from the 6 to 12. Meanwhile, this kid and his sheep were moving toward the village 9 to 3. The Blackhawk swings around and drops a flare about 500 meters away. The mortars sergeant shouts to me that he's marking a target. So I get in a good position and observe. The kid keeps moving closer to where the flare had been dropped and I start thinking to myself that the Blackhawk can't engage because the kid is too close on one side, our soldiers are too close on the other, and this fucking target is in between a draw of a large cliff face and this hilltop where the village is. A few moments later the Blackhawk drops a flare almost 300 meters away, and the mortars sergeant tells me to shoot him. I confirm, and he repeats the command. I'm thinking he and the helicopter are on fires net, so yeah he would know what's up. Even so, I wait to make sure. I'm looking through my ACOG, and through the smoke I see green glint tape wrapped around a triangle shape at the guy's hip. I've seen this stuff before in Afghanistan. I found them on the buttstocks of many AK's to show which group these people belong to. I steady my breath and slowly pull the trigger, then he drops. If there's one thing I was best at while serving, it was shooting. I used to put dimes in targets, then put holes in them and put them on my dog tag chain so my guys would listen to me when I trained them how to shoot. I wish I wasn't as good. 

I called out, he's down, and the sergeant was floored. He started saying, I said search him. I took my guys and we charged the target to find an old man bleeding out beside a fucking bicycle. His busted seat was taped up with glint tape. I got him center right of his pelvis, and got his artery. I tired to stop it, but there was nothing I could do. He kept whispering allah until he got slower and slower and stopped. His blood soaked my gloves, sleeves and pants. 

The OIC was pissed, a fucking butter bar right out of college. He found out where this guy was from, then had me push his bike to the next village over so I could tell his family through our interpreter that their father, grandfather, uncle, husband was dead. When we got back to post, there was an investigation and they threw me under the bus. I'm not saying I didn't deserve it, and I live with that shame today, but it was harsh. They took my gun and squad from me and ran missions without me. The mortars sergeant had his whole team with him who confirmed he said search, while I just had myself and one of my privates with me who heard him say otherwise. As I was an attachment to their company, none of their people stood up for me. My PSG wasn't there, and my LT was a recent transfer and buddy buddy with the LT who made me push the bike, so he was down with their decisions. The only thing that saved me from doing prison time was the fact that our company was attached to the unit I served in before. They reached out to my old company and decided that I wasn't a trigger happy sociopath. Honestly, though, if I hadn't been recently married, traumatized by my service in Iraq, and responsible for all these other soldiers, I probably would have hesitated a moment longer for the smoke to clear. Truth is, I was fucking scared when I pulled that trigger. I got off with a wrist slap. After that, I just rode out my enlistment and got out. 

The years after my seperation weren't so great. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. My wife urged me to got to community college, so I did. She graduated from nursing school and started nursing while I collected service-related disability checks and my college funds. We weren't wealthy by any means, but we were getting by. A year out of service, she wanted to start a family. I wasn't sure I was ready, but she was. So we had our first when I graduated CC. I transferred to a state college with the hopes of teaching. I did well in both CC and College, and my wife wanted to have a second kid. I was doing pretty well as a father and a student, and I really love babies, so I was all for it.

About 6 months in to her pregnancy, my brother committed suicide out of nowhere it seemed. He was my best friend, and we stayed in touch even though we were on opposite sides of the country. I was shocked. He left no note. I spiralled into depression and eventually ended up hospitalized for suicidal ideation.

It was a nightmare.

I got out, graduated top of my class and started teaching as an adjunct at community colleges while planning on getting my masters to qualify for a full-time position. My wife and I had become very distant at this point, which she attributes entirely to my PTSD and Depression, and will never admit that her job - which pays below the national a average for her position - was harming our relationship. I asked her, begged her to look into finding somewhere else that wasn't a non-profit and paid her so little with such crappy benefits, but she wouldn't have it. Instead, she decided that it was time for a third baby. 

I didn't want more than two, but she the only affection she showed me was when she wanted to get pregnant. Me being so starving for attention, capitulated. Our third was born just before the holidays, and she finally had Thanksgiving and Christmas off. Shortly after our third was born, our house burned down while we were away. I don't know what caused it, something in our storage closet under the stairs, but we lost everything. At the same time, I got a full ride to graduate school, then moved out of state. It was awful, but I tried to look at it as a sign that it was a fresh start.

It wasn't. Things only got worse. I got to grad school and was much older than my cohorts. I had three kids, a wife who worked all the time, continued to deal with my PTSD and Depression, then had to focus on my school work only when the kids were asleep. I had been so used to only getting 3 - 4 hours of sleep a night, it didn't really seem like such a big deal to me at the time, but I was falling apart. I had no friends and I had fallen out of contact with everyone I served with. Honestly, I really didn't want to talk with them because everytime I did, they would just rehash shit I didn't want to talk about anyway.

I graduated and we moved back south, closer to her where she worked before. I thought this was a great idea because she wouldn't be so tired all the time with a long commute and would start making time for us. She didn't. Instead, she started taking on more and more shifts, even though she wasn't required to do so. We lived in a 3 bedroom apartment, barely getting by. I had to give up looking for teaching jobs at the CC level because they simply didn't exist. I got secretary work at a local university because the pay was okay and the benefits and hours were good, but I fucking hated it with every fiber of my being. I did this for us, but she didn't care. She just wanted a 4th. Starved of attention, I gave in and agreed.

We still were struggling, so after a couple of years I got a better paying job doing the same bullshit. She was still tired all the time, and I was doing everything I could so she could rest. All of my time was dedicated to work, therapy, going to the gym so I could stay in shape for her hoping that she would be more attracted to me - the gym also had free childcare, so she got a break from the kids too - and then when I got back from the gym, she'd be hiding in the bedroom while I did dinners and bedtime with the kids. Nights would run long with 4 kids always up at some point or another, and I was always her catcher in the rye to keep them from disturbing her much needed rest. I was operating on maybe about 2 - 3 hours of sleep a day at this point, and just losing it.

She decided that she needed time away from work, and the best way to do this was to have a 5th baby. We had only been having sex maybe twice a year at this point, and I no longer slept in her room. When I did, she'd kick me out for snoring or twitching, but I think she just got so used to having a bed to herself, she no longer wanted anyone in it. Obviously, I agreed because I was so desperate at this point for some kind of validation that I couldn't say no to another child.

I was already drowning at this point with responsibilities, so when the 5th was born I was a zombie. A year after our 5th, I broke down to her telling her how unloved and isolated I felt. Her response was that it was time I go back to the hospital. What I needed was for her to get a different job or just spend more time with me, but she wouldn't hear it. It was all my PTSD. It was all my Depression. So I agreed and went.

The first time I was hospitalized, I didn't have insurance. I spent 3 days there and then was out. This time, I had good insurance and even though I had no suicide ideation, I stayed their 14 days, and it was terrible. It was so bad that when a schizophrenic had an episode at dinner, the med techs ran out of the dining room, locking us in with him. He was fucking violent, throwing chairs and shit, and I had to fucking take him down. I was so fucking furious and further traumatized by my treatment there. Moreover, they used that event against me to hold me there several more days.

Three weeks ago, my wife told me that we were too broken to be fixed and wanted a to seperate. I was floored. I didn't see it coming at all. I had sacrificed so much for this relationship. I had gone through so much shit. She ignored my needs for so long, and all this time I over extended myself for her.

I started paying more attention to her habits with her phone. She never left it unguarded, and then when she did, she had changed her password. I suspected her of having an affair, and confronted her about it. She said she wasn't having an affair, so I asked for her phone. She gave it to me, as well as the new pin, so I went and recovered all the deleted data from it. She thought she was so clever deleting all of her messages she didn't want me to find, but I found them anyway.

Not only was she having an affair, she was talking so much shit about me to her closest non-mutual friends for over three years. I was destroyed. In her messages, she showed so much sympathy for people who had similar mental health issues as myself, but when it came to me, she just said I was being a jackass or lazy. There were so many messages about how I had time off coming up, so she would be happy to take someone else's shift so they could spend time with their family's etc while I watched our kids. 

She would brag about how she had few home visits to do, so she would just go to a coffee shop and read and flirt. She complained about how she should have listened to her mother and married rich, then always sign off with 'make good decisions' as if our life together all these years had been a joke.

She went to work that day, and I attempted suicide. I put a taped a thick plastic bag over my head after taking a handful of seroquel and went to sleep at 3 am. Before I did so, I stupidly sent her an email, telling her that this was my decision and I couldn't live with my pain anymore while reassuring her that it wasn't her fault. I fell asleep, then woke up at 6 am with the police at my door. In my sleep, I had torn the bag off. She called me, telling me to answer the door, and I didn't want to. I was talking as if I had had a stroke, and if I had the foresight to bing my hands behind my back, I wouldn't be alive today. They took me to the ER and made me sign paperwork to have me admitted to another inpatient facility. I was so out of it, I had no idea what I was signing.

I spent a week there, doing everything they expected and making no complaints. 

After I was released, I stayed with a sibling while I waited for my lease at a new apartment would start. 

I've been here about a week now and haven't return to work next Monday. Since I wasn't working, my wife asked me to have the kids stay with me. I agreed. I love my children, and I missed them. I regretted deeply what I had done, but this whole week all I can think about is how she has had all this free time to fuck around and laugh at me. She still looks great, is smart, funny, and as we all know, dudes will stick their dicks in anything that gives them attention. It makes me sick to think about. 

She gets the kids back tonight, and I am by myself. I've locked myself in my room while they watch Netflix and the oldest gets them snacks. I know they love me very much, but I can't stand to be around them right now. I see them and all I think is how my wife used them as a way to make sure I stay around so I could support her while she did a job she loves for so little compensation while also getting dick from some side guy. 

Now she's in grad school and graduating soon and will be making as much as both of our salaries combined. I've really reached the top of my earnings in life and won't get much further. I live in a shitty 2 br apartment with 5 kids visiting several days a week. They are enjoying their time now, but when they become teenagers, they're not going to want to share a room with each other. It's really just a matter of time before they start despising me too and stop coming. 

I don't know why I'm even still going at this point. It's almost as if everyone would be much better off if I just got a large life insurance policy and somehow induce a heart attack. I have so little to cling to and no more hope. I don't see myself with any better job prospects while being able to support my children because any teaching job I get now would be a severe salary cut. I don't see anyone finding me attractive enough to be with, and if someone somehow found me attractive, would they really want to be with a dude who already has 5 kids?

I'm on fumes here, have no one I trust to talk to because I am so very afraid of being treated like a criminal again and thrown in cuffs and taken to a useless facility which does nothing but make me worse.

On the scale of things, I just see my life as a pile of shit that just keeps stacking up higher and higher. I no longer believe that it gets better because I can't see any way forward. At this point, I just need to vent, I think, and then move forward.

Thank you.",,Depressed

I am a teenager in high school and have a friend who is currently struggling with depression. There have been comments made about suicide, and I am worried. They have spoken to the school counselor, and their advice was to talk to a doctor and get medication. My friend says they cannot talk to their parents about this issue, and feels that their parents will not believe them or help them. Knowing them, this is probably true.

"My friends kick me out of their group because I muted them Backstory:

I recently joined a group of people to play with them from r/reddeadonline and we have been great friends since the first few days. 

Story:

Today me and another friend were playing red dead online and the rest of them that were in the party were playing fallout 76. I don’t care i just mind my business mostly paying attention to the person I’m playing red dead online with. 

Apparently something happened in fol76 that causes all 3 of them to start screaming their asses off. With a headset set to max volume, that will give anyone ear trauma. I simply mute them because 1. They were playing a game that i wasn’t and were having conversations that i wasn’t. And 2. They were screaming into their mics about god knows what it was half gibberish. I mute them and move on. 

Not even 5 minutes later the person I’m playing red dead online with tells me to unmute them and I do, as I trusted that friend. They greet me with them calling me a “toxic asshole” and that i should go fuck my self. I remain calm (although I would normally return the favor with more insults, however I felt that  it would only make the situation worse if I added feud to the fire) while trying to defuse the situation. They are getting so toxic and so pissed off. I don’t even understand why. So I just ask them when are they being so toxic, what could I have done? Well it was because I muted them, they were this upset because i muted them because they were screaming at a fucking shithole that was fol76. 

I just state that I was going to mute them again to let them calm down and realize what there were doing and saying. After that they BLEW UP. They even started throwing personal insults and were screaming as loud as they could. I muted them because I just didnt have the energy to argue them especially when they were this mad. Another 15 minutes later my friend tells me to unmute them and I did as I actually thought they had calmed down. Which they did, to a degree. They calmly said that they were going to make a vote to kick me out of the group, “for what?” I ask. And they just say “for muting us, as this kind of toxic behavior is not allowed in our group”. What about them screaming and cursing at me because i muted them because they were yelling before? What about when they were wishing I get a deadly disease and that my mom gets killed because I muted them? They chose to forget that ever happened because not mentioning it would have benefited them more than actually just forgiving me mad moving on.

They hold a vote and the very biased poll was the three toxic assholes that started this mess FOR kicking me out of the group, and the one AGAINST kicking me out of the group was my loyal friend that is actually a good friend. So obviously I get kicked out. They kick me from the party. And my friend says that he will remain in the group but i don’t care since I know he doesnt have any trouble with them and I can’t force him to leave. 

Yea I need to find some new friends to play with but I’m pretty glad that they kicked me out because I don’t want to play with anyone who acts like this anyway, so at least i won’t have to worry about them ever again.",,Anxious

"most people I know don’t know much about tics so I’m here to educate for not apparent reason :D Hi! I have anxiety tics, so I’m here to do a bit of education on the common misconceptions around tics!

so what are tics? Tics are basically involuntary movements and sounds that your body makes, for example tongue clicking, winking, head shakes (etc). Tics are completely involuntary and can’t always be suppressed.

Tics are not the same as Tourettes. Tics can be caused by Tourettes, but they are a by-product of Tourettes, which is a deeper set neurological disorder (most commonly passed down from parents). Tics can be caused by a number of other things, such as trauma, anxiety, depression and disorders like ADHD, and sometimes they can just come out of nowhere. Tourettes is something you have to live your whole life with, whereas if you have just tics, they can fade or even leave completely with time.

The difference between tics and stims? Stims are much less commonly known than tics, but they are movements that are involuntary, but it can make the person holding the stim feel uncomfortable, anxious and nauseous until they do the movement. This is commonly caused by ADHD and neurological disorders that are similar to it.

Tics can be anything, not just cuss words. This is something I hear a lot from my classmates, but tics aren’t just cuss words, in fact a very small amount of people with tics/Tourettes have tics that are mainly just cussing. For example, some of my tics are slapping my forehead, “RAIN” tongue clicking, tensing my shoulders and bopping my head forward, and occasionally the f word, and that’s just the most common ones, people’s tics and stims have a huge variety.

Tics are inconsistent, you can tic for one whole day and not tic for three days, or you can tic for 20 minutes and not tic for an hour, most people with tics do not tic all the time, and if you think someone if faking their tics because they are not ticking when you see them sometimes, they’re probably not ^^. 

Talking about tics and seeing other people tic can trigger tics to start. In my experience when I’m talking about my tics or being asked questions about them, it can send me into a full tic attack (when your tics come too fast with too many and it makes you basically unable to do anything except tic, it’s extremely tiring and sometimes painful). Just because people tic more when they are thinking about their tics does not mean they’re faking, it’s normal, just like how when you notice a cut it starts to hurt more.

Everyones experience with tics is different. My tics personally do not hurt (unless they are actions like hitting myself) but many peoples tics are physically painful just from the tic itself. Different things trigger different peoples tics, such as large groups of people, sounds they dislike, over stimulation (having a sudden wave of really strong emotion, like getting really excited, or hearing or seeing something that is really overwhelming to your sensory system. This can be something that your sensory system likes, or something it dislikes.) Some people can hold their tics in and feel fine, some people can hold their tics in and feel uncomfortable/nauseous, some people can’t hold their tics in at all! It’s different for everyone, and their is so much variation in tics that to put it all into a box would be insane.

People can develop tics based on things they see. For example, I saw a tiktok that was saying various Japanese phrases, and now I have a tic that says ‘gomen ne’. And, unfortunately, tics can mirror words like slurs. This is not the person who is tickings fault, and obviously it’s not a good thing and I’m not defending people who use slurs, but tics are completely involuntary, and it’s likely if you ask about the tic (if you meet someone who has a tic that is a slur), it makes the tic worse, and it’s also possible for the tic to stop happening after a while.

People with tics are not just doing it for attention, yes there are a small percentage of fucked up people who think faking tics for attention is okay and do it themselves, but if you think about it, WHY THE HELL WOULD I CHOOSE TO YELL ‘wOah that rainfall looks like c*m!’ In the middle of class. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD CHOOSE TO DO THAT? 

Tics can stop when you’re focusing really hard on something, like eyeliner, or writing.

and another random point, people with tic disorders and Tourettes are actually exempt from masks, because having something touching your face like that can trigger tics in some people. though if you have tics that aren’t triggered by wearing a mask, please do! For the sake of the people. Also if you tell someone you have tics to get out of wearing a mask I will come for your kneecaps.

OKAY! That’s all I can think of right now, if I remember anything else I’ll edit this to add it, please be wary of people with tics and do your best to avoid staring at them or asking about the tics (as it can make it worse). Have a good morning/evening/life and I wish you all the best!

"Coming CleanIt's easy to fear nothing when you don't have anything left to lose.

The past few weeks have been numbing. Blow after blow, after all the tragedies that happened and are happening in my life, it felt like I am on auto-pilot. It felt like I'm underwater and all I could hear are murmurs from above. The silence inside of me is defeaning, but the low rumbles of comfort from the thought of the end filled my lungs. 

I did things that I'd never done before and didn't feel anything about it. Things that should make me angry didn't bother me anymore, and even my former inhibitions didn't matter now too. 

I've sent my nudes to multiple men when they asked.I remembered I was called a prude before but now it didn't matter. I've given my belongings to people who want them. People who are tying to help me received the most pessimistic and toxic responses from me until they leave me. It's better that way. I've already arranged things in order and just waiting for my salary so that my sister won't have problems with my funeral.I won't be able to see my parents. It's been a while since I visited them in prison. I wish they can get out to see me and get to enjoy the day before they get back to the facility. 


For the people who will hold my phone after I'm gone.

Thank you to anyone who tried to help me and are worried about me. None of this is your fault. This is what I think is the only way to escape from my life. I've been struggling from this since I was 16 and after 11 years, I've decided it is time to rest. 

Do not feel bad or feel any regret about not saving me. I don't want to be helped anymore, because I am beyond saving.

Know that I have loved each and every one of you with every fiber of my being at one point in my life and know that I carried that memory with me until the moment I did it. 

I'm sorry for causing all this trouble and I hope you could forgive me.",,Depressed

This is just a constant reminder of how much my life sucks and I'll be forever alone.

"Why do cartoons do this [important] To all the guys/gals/non-binary pals out there, if a girl picks on you, there's a low chance they like you and a high chance their just being a dick.


I've seen this trope a few times in cartoons, and I don't know why they're glorifying this type of stuff. In the Loud House episode ""Heavy Meddler"" (I think that's what it's called), a girl named Ronnie Anne kept picking on Lincoln, and all Lincoln's sisters said RA likes him. L kept denying it, but his sisters were right. Kids might take this episode and think ""Hey, if it worked out for him, maybe it'll work out for me!"" This is one of my least favorite tropes in cartoons, because they can make kids think that if someone bullies you, they wanna be your soulmate, when there's a high ass chance it's the complete opposite and they are just bullying you.


So people, please know that this trope in cartoons is wrong. I don't know why this happens, but it does. While other tropes like the dumbass dad are annoying, this is plain DANGEROUS! Hopefully writers stop using this trope, because if I see it one more time, I'm gonna pull my hair out.",,Stressed

"For those of you who have a job, what motivates you to work? (read below)I ask this because of the unique situation I'm in.

I'm  not mentally up to par, and nobody here thinks of that optimistically.  There is no ""have hope maybe one day you will find a relationship"", the  circumstances set it in stone that I won't, especially the population  decline here where everyone I once knew has migrated away. Actually, my  plan A in life was to marry nobody and adopt my children as a single  father as I have so little libido that I wasn't initially interested in a  relationship. However, social services here has been documented to be  rigged against the mentally disabled, and I can provide the  documentation to the skeptical. There are a lot of people with trust  issues with them, apparently enough according to newspapers that it  affects child statistics. And even after looking for one for a decade  now, I have no hobbies, either because nothing matches the aspects I'm  interested in or because I am a tad emotionally numb for hobbies, the  same numbness that makes me apathetic towards luxuries like a house  bigger than a single room.

If you want a  metaphor for working in this life, picture a guy who is filling his car  with gas, but the ""car"" is a prop and he's just filling up cardboard. My  parents always suggest getting SSI, they're the ones pioneering the  idea. However, I've been denied thrice.

"I'm a sociopath.... Shouldn't I kill myself before I continue to hurt other people... and destroy them...Let's just face the facts and admit one truth... Some people seriously do not deserve to be on this planet and should be killed off. People the likes of Hitler, for instance. We can admit that, right? Other people who are sociopaths/psychopaths, suffer from serious mental disorders that causes harm to others... The person behind 9/11.... Etc. Some people simply should be killed off.

If that's true, then shouldn't I be categorized as one of those people, and... Shouldn't I just kill myself to save others?

Sorry for the long wall of text but... I need to get something off my chest and... I just.. Idk... I just can't handle this anymore...... I'm going to start from recently and go back... And just... idk... At the end... if anybody actually reads this all the way... guess ... Idk... Shouldn't I just kill myself after everything I've done in my past? I know there's rules against being mean to people on here... But I need a person's honest opinion... Like legitimately if you feel like I'm a horrible person.. Tell me... So I know.. (People keep telling me I'm not that horrible... but I just feel so horrible....) I'm not even going to defend my actions.... Just list them.. Because honestly my actions are unforgiveable no matter what my excuse was....

Very recently.. I did something extremely badly.... And... Well... My grandma... had cancer... no longer does... extremely bad news...Uh... I still can't admit it to myself what happened... as far as I believe she's still in some hospital I refuse to visit because I just can't see her.... Yeah... Uh. Yeh. She's in a hopsital... Yeah... 

Anyways... Ever since then... my fiance and I drifted apart drastically... we talked every day... then we talked once a day... then once every other day... to like once a week... to like... weeks without talking... On top of that... she would throw a huge tamper tantrum whenever I talked to anybody at all... So past 2 and a half years I haven't had anybody to talk to. (except very recently I posted to /r4r a lot) I worked nonstop doing delivery services, picking up food, and delivering to customers only saying ""enjoy"" once they open the door. Extent of my human interaction... So... I mean logically I'm pretty messed up.. humans need human interaction... right? 

I begged my fiance to talk to me..... Begged her, yelled at her, demanded her attention... Not all at once... but it just kept getting worse with her ignoring me... so I became more and more demanding. 

It got so bad.... I... I... We spent 8 days without talking to each other... My grandma's funeral.... was coming up next week....... I... Needed her attention.... Badly.... She refused.... So I told her... I'd post her nudes online  if she continues treating me this way... continues ignoring me... Spent the 2 days threatening her... then finally posted the nudes online... I eventually deleted the nudes, and deleted everything but.... Still. She's a teacher and that could've lost her her job.  I told her ""Just... say.. 'h...i... then press send....' and I won't post your nudes online..."" and she couldn't even do that.... That was too much for her apparently... So I posted the nudes... And.... She went to the police with everything... wanted a restraining order against me just to stop me from posting nudes.... I honestly thought she didn't care for me anymore... I mean she couldn't even say hi to me... So... I did what I had in order to push her away... in order for us to break up... in order for me to have somebody be there for me when my grandma's... funeral.... date... is coming up... I desperately either needed us to break up so I can seek somebody else to be there (just platonic friendship... which I found)... or she needs to start being there for me... Which she couldn't even be there for me.... So... I had to break us up by posting.... Only way I could get her to hate me enough to break up with me.... Very manipulative, very sociopathic... wouldn't you say? I told somebody in jail this... and... They called me a sociopath. He was all like ""Woooah woooah dude holy fuck remind me not to mess with you you fucking sociopath"" I don't know if he was kidding but... I think he was serious about thinking I'm a sociopath... 

Well... now I'm facing extortion, revenge porn, and a lot of misdeameners and I think the DA is pressing charges. 

I know we both did not wanted it to go this far.... I know I didn't... All I wanted was her to just say hi to me...... Give me some human interaction.... I know if we talk... And talk it out... She can send a letter to the DA and have them drop the charges.... But.... With the restraining order in place... there's nothing I can do. So I'm fucked. 

So that happened... and now I feel extremely horrible because... I spent time in jail just thinking of the past and how it all came to be... her friend committed suicide around the time my grandma.... so we both have been grieving.... And... We just needed each other... I begged her to talk... She drifted away...

So now... Here's why I'm suicidal...I'm just gonna list things....

One... I was abused really badly... all the abuse you can imagine.. I'd probably suffered through it. or similar... 

Two... Abused people often become abusers....

Three.. I'm a pretty attractive guy - but I never got into a relationship because I feared becoming an abuser... I have to be ready for a relatioship before I even think about getting into one... otherwise I'd abuse them.... And hurt them... 

Four... I dated my first girlfriend... I thought I was ready for a relationship... been through counseling enough....Nope. She broke up because I""m abusive. Her words, not mine.

Five... Spent the next 5 years single because I wasn't going to abuse another person... Not going to risk it.... My fiance entered my life... My abuser's name was brought up... I was extremely pissed... my fiance hugged me and calmed me down... I thought I was ready for a relationship... If she could do that... then I'm ready. But I wasn't... I shouldn't rely on somebody else to calm me down... I need to calm myself down.

Six... I spent years in counseling... Years trying to get better.. Yet here I am 26 years old and still abusing the love of my life... I betrayed her in such a way... she's never going to recover from.... I hadn't realized how vulnerable she was... There's nothign I can do to become better.... I've tried for years... been in counseling since 7....And I'm still a piece of shit person....

seven...And all of this.... I don't... think... I care about how much I hurt her... Because of how much she hurt me... Abandoning me.. forcing me into solitude for years... Not hearing how desperately I needed her... I don't really care she's hurting... What I care about is... That I hurt her. I promised myself I would never abuse another person... and here I am abusing her... And... I hate myself for it.. It doesn't matter who the person is - I don't care they're getting hurt.... All I care about is that I'm the one doing the abuse... And I hate myself for turning into my step father... 

Eight... Doesn't that make me a sociopath? How I don't care she's hurt? She put herself into this situation... I begged her to just.. say.. hi.. to me... and I'll stop being so demanding... Just say hi.. How difficult is that.... Just talk to me... 

Nine... I have serious anger issues.... I suppose..... I posted nudes and betrayed her trust all because she wouldn't talk to me? For reals? 

Ten... I'm scared of what I can do when I'm angry... legitimately scared... I black out.. I don't remember a single thing when I'm pushed to my limit... And I do... things.. 

Eleven..I haven't gotten pushed to my limit for over 10 years... But I'm still scared of what I can do... Last time... I was a sophomore in high school.. and this senior football player threw a football at my face... and it hurt... just the way my step dad would slap my face... PTSD kicked in... rampage ensured... I got the ball and threw it at him as hard as i could aimed at his balls... I remember this.. wasn't pushed to my limit just yet... Then I ran off... went to fifth period... completely shaking the entire period... went to sixth period and the guy was there... he pushed me into a corner.. And I had no escape... No way out.. And he was pissing me off..So... I lost it... He pushed me to my limit.. I don't remember what happened. Next thing I knew.. I was hiding at the corner of the school crying so much... and my teacher found me... calmed me down... and brought me back. Next thing I know, I'm facing some serious charges which didn't stick. And they wanted to sue me.  Again, I don't care about the dude... all I care about is the fact that.. I lost control of my own anger and hurt another person... I don't care I hurt him, I care that I did something that was wrong...

Twelve... I used to play RuneScape... A lot.... 'twas addicted... my grandpa works on the computer... he lets me use his work computer to play... I usually get on 2-3 hours after school... And.. play as long as possible.... He's losing money...Anyways.. He wants me to go to bed at 11pm... I stay till 1am... Keep bitching at him.. He can't do anything.. Then he's had it and told me to go to bed.. I lost it... blacked out... And my own grandpa is laying on the stairs completely unconscious... his head is bleeding... I.... ... I ALMOST KILLED HIM!!! I COULD'VE KILLED HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just for that alone I should be dead.... right? He fell down the stairs... could've been exxtremely bad... but luckily he didn't die...  ... And guess what.. I still don't care if he died... I cared that... I lost control of my anger... became just like my step dad.. and abused another person.... Such a sociopathic thought... right? 

Thirdteen... Uh.. Backtrack to last year... My grandma had cancer... she was in the hospitall on... on.. her.. on. her bed... uh.. bed bed.. And I never came by. I couldn't bear to see her in such a state..Ever since I foudn her she had cancer... I've been distancing myself from her... I didn't even attend the funeral... Why should I when I can work? I didn't care enough to go... I wanted to work... 

Fourteen.. My baby sister... I have two... one I'm attached to and would do anything to protect.. I saw her grow up... I was there... I love her. But I haven't been around... at all... for years... Because... Idk how to do family.. They never asked me over... So I never came over... I mean they'd ask my other sister over... So why couldn't they ask me too? Anyways.. my other baby sister.. who I'm not attached to almost died.... she was in the ER.. ICC.. everything and... I never came by. I wanted to work instead. I need money.... Deliveries don't pay that much... I'm barely surviving being homeless living in the van... So I have to work..  Same with my father.. he just came out of the ER a couple weeks ago.. and I haven't cared enough to visit... So.. I'm a sociopath right? 

Fifteen... Unless somebody benefits me.. Like gives me something.. Free rent... Or food... or money... Or if I expect something from them, then I'll talk to them... Otherwise I don't, even if they talk to me. That's super selfish, isn't it? My grandpa bought me a motorcycle... And I talked to him every day before I got it... Once I got it... I stopped talking to him. A lot has been going on recently so maybe that's why I haven't talked to him... but...  part of me thinks I stopped talking to him because I no longer expect him to give me anything... 

Sixteen... I went to jail.... I talked to my mom and dad for the first time in 2+ years... Because I needed them to bail me out or something... 

Seventeen.. Literally going through this right now... I finally got a job... a career... Three months working.. I no longer have to be homeless... I can finally get my life together... I can finally make something out of my life... And my grandpa had a stroke... He needs me to come up visit him and stay with him for a couple weeks... I simply don't want to. I want to stay here and show my worth to the company so they can keep me on for years to come... I love it here.. And I don't want to lose my job... lose my career... lose my life all to go support my grandpa... Like that's truly socipathic, isn't it...

Eighteen... I honestly feel the only way I haven't turned to killing people is because... I've never crossed any lines... My grandpa gave me a set moral compass once upon a time... And... I haven't blurred the lines or crossed the lines or anything... until very recently. I haven't even jaywalked... because I'd be scared of the outcome... Anyways... one day I was sitting home alone and everybody was supposed to be gone for the entire night... My cat came to my... and I so badly wanted to choke the cat... Had my hands around his neck... etc.. then somebody came home... and I let the cat go. If I crossed that line.... Idk... I feel like i could've easily moved on to humans. 

I just....

Everybody keeps telling me life will get better... Etc. You'll move past this.. You'll move on... 

But nobody understands....

It's not something I can just... move on... Or move past... Yes breaking up with my fiance... having my heart broken by her... All of this... is making me extremely suicidal.... But... I'm suicidal because... of how I treat people... Of the way I behave... of how I act.. Of how I think... of how I don't have emotions.. or empathy... or care... or anything...

I know enough about sociopaths and shit like that... ever since I was a child... I mean... My dog hated me. That's a red flag, isn't it? When a dog is scared of a sociopathic child.... that's.. Idk. Our dog never liked me. Probably because I kept doing things to it. When our cat died, I wanted to see the body and... Just play with it. 

Anybody seen Dexter? I feel exactly like Dexter. Hell.. I even love Blood like he does.. And I'd love to cut up a live human being just to see how they react... I'd love to see how they scream... How much pain I can inflict...  I'd love to see how much I can make them react.. Just the mere thought of it brings excitement... Lots of excitement... And... I've never done anything to... Try and... Do anything like it.. I wouldn't get a pet because I'd be scared of how I'd treat the pet... Maybe if I had the opportunity to kill my dog or cat as a child...  I swear I would've became just like Dexter... I'm serious scared of what I can do if I continue down a dark path... Because I know.. I know I can become a serial killer... So I've been scared to pass any lines... always sticking to some moral guideline my grandpa instilled in me...Follow the law... to the letter.. Don't even jaywalk otherwise you're putting yourself in a situation where the lines will get blurred and you'll seriously hurt somebody... (e.i. release nudes to the internet...)WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID!!!! The lines were blurred... And that's how I got this far....

No matter what I tried, I couldn't interact with anyone without being awkward and uncomfortable. If I ever got close to anyone, I was too much of a trainwreck to keep them around. It's sad how many people have tried to be my friend, only to have me find some way to drive them back. 

And now here I am, as a working adult. My peers are all getting married, figuring out their lives. And I'm here, a miserable wreck who had to use the word ""peers"" because I simply don't have friends. There's no room for a broken person like me in their lives anymore.

I don’t have time to see their face before they bite my arm and run away. “What the-”, I say before realising I’ve dropped the dog leash. I run to catch up with the young, brown retriever I named Gwaine. I look around for the weirdo that left imprints on my arm, but all I see is the rain starting to pour. I hear shouting of something indistinguishable and decide it’s time to get out of here. “What is with people today?”, I wonder as I head towards my flat. 

The wound on my arm bleeds slightly so I don’t think much of it. I do feel dizzy though, so I decide to take a lie down. But the dog won’t stop barking, disrupting any sleep I hoped to get. I grab a glass from the kitchen and head into the bathroom to find the paracetamol. My arm starts bleeding more so I decide to clean that as well. I look in the mirror. I look awful. I'm paper white, my short dirty blonde hair is stuck to my forehead and I have dark bags under my blue eyes. I look like a ghost. Another wave of nausea runs over me, so I quickly take the paracetamol and run back to my room.

I can’t sleep. Gwaine won’t stop barking and I keep hearing rumbles of thunder, so I just sit for a bit. I feel a bit better, so I decide to get up and watch the lightning. I go to stand but I fall back down and smack my head off my bedpost. My vision’s spotty, and my eyes begin to shut. I can’t tell if my head’s bleeding. The last thing I remember is that dog barking.

Her straight blonde hair is shoulder length and perfectly cut, her face completely symmetrical and she doesn’t even blink. I decide she must be CGI because she’s so perfect. But her voice is more noticeably unnatural. She speaks in a monotone voice and her words are choppy. Not as obvious as Google Translate but still flawed. What she’s speaking about is even stranger: she’s saying there is no hope, we are all doomed and we should’ve obeyed. Obeyed what? I try change the channel. She's still there. I try again. She’s still there. I turn it off and on again. She’s still there. Hackers? I wonder where Gwaine is. He’ll be hungry. I thought he’d be barking his head off by now. I get up off the floor, feeling my head rush. I’m about to leave the room when I see crumpled sheets of paper with my handwriting on it. I read what they say:

“Tuesday 26th: My skin itches. It feels like there’s bugs underneath it. A woman on the TV says the world has ended. I am alone, only Gwaine is here to keep me company, but he won’t stop barking.

Friday 29th: Something is wrong. My veins are black. My teeth are sharp. I keep forgetting things – like my name! The dog won’t stop barking. I keep waking up in random places in my flat. I go through periods of gaining consciousness and not remembering anything from before.

Saturday 30th: Itchy. Scratchy. Dog stopped barking, probably cause I ate his face in. Going through fits o-”
This can’t be right. It’s not been a week. I was only asleep for a day. I check the TV guide to confirm my suspicions, but it doesn’t. It says it’s Monday the 1st. What does this mean? Where’s my dog?

“GWAINE!”, I shout, desperately hoping for his charming face to appear. He doesn’t. I open the door to the hall when the smell hits me: the smell of rotting flesh. I just know then that it’s my best friend.

I run. Down the hall, through the door, down the stairs and out onto the streets. I ignore the rain drenching my clothes. I don’t stop until I see the mob of seemingly decomposing bodies with ripped and bloody clothing stumble over each other in my direction. Then they’re all blown to bits, just like that. 

“HEY!”, a girl’s voice shouts at me. She runs over to me, her long dark hair swinging madly in its ponytail. She has a kind but tough face. “What’re you doing out in the open?”

“What?”

“It’s not safe out here”, I stare at her blankly. “Do you have any clue what’s going on?”

“No? What are those things?”

“I call them mutts, but they’re practically zombies. Contagious experiments gone wrong. Now they’ve taken over everyone.”, She looks at the bite on my arm and hands me a water bottle with a clumpy orange liquid in it. “Drink it. It'll stop the mutation temporarily.”, There’s something trustworthy about her so I do. It tastes vile, like orange juice and toothpaste mixed in with crushed ibuprofen. I gag and force it down. “And here, take this.”, she hands me a black waterproof jacket, I take it gratefully. I don’t know when I started shivering but it’s uncontrollable now although the rain has stopped to a slow drizzle. “Why’re you out here alone?”

“I... don’t know. I woke up on the floor and there were these notes written by me, but I don’t remember writing them and it says I killed my dog...”, my voice trails off.

“It’s okay. It happens after you’re bitten. It happened to my sister. I’m Eos by the way.”, she holds her hand out for me to shake, I take it.

“I’m Arthur.”

"I'm afraid I've finally fallen too far...I don't have a plan, or anything, but thinking about not being here is becoming more common.  Things are impossibly difficult and nothing I do seems to change my situation.  I've never attempted suicide or even really threatened but I feel like I have nothing to stop me now.

I grew up in an impoverished, abusive, and addicted home.  I was beaten pretty regularly and emotionally manipulated constantly and it left me a broken mess.  As an adult, I've failed more than I succeeded but still kept pushing along because I thought maybe I could make a life for myself that wasn't so bad.

It took me twice as long as my peers but I eventually finished college and even grad school.  I had a few relationships, made a few friends, scored a few jobs but nothing lasted because I don't know how to get close to people.  I craved a family of my own and so, mid-30's, I decided to move in with a guy I thought I could love and who would love me.

I gave up everything to be with him including job, car, house, friends, family, and eventually savings.  I moved across country for his work and within the first week, I knew something was wrong.  Turns out this dude is pretty abusive behind closed doors and I immediately collapsed into myself and froze for the last 5 years.

I haven't had access to medical care or a healthy environment.  I finally fought hard to go to the doctor and found out I have kidney disease and a bunch of other problems.  I have two molars that are broken in half and so painful.  I haven't been able to walk more than a few feet at a time since he shoved me to the ground 4 years ago.  My body is very weak and my mind is following the same path.

I used to think I could survive regardless of what was tossed my way.  I thought of myself as resourceful and resilient and tough.  I know now, I'm not and I can feel myself detaching from a need to stay here on this planet.  I don't have kids.  I don't have coworkers or friends or much family.  I don't have anyone who would miss me but my cats and my dad whom I support financially.  Correction, who I supported financially until the money ran out.

In the last year, so many family members have died that I'm down to only two blood relatives beyond distant cousins.  I didn't make it home for any of their funerals because I can't break free from here.  I am just completely unattached and the negative self talk swarms every other perception and attempt at understanding.

I'm not innocent. I'm not a victim.  I made a choice to stay.  I could have left before I was physically and emotionally paralyzed.  I can't now, though, and that's what has me thinking about suicide.  I think my only peace will come when I'm gone but he won't let me leave and I really have no place to go even if he did cut me loose.  I need him, as shitty as that is... as shitty as that makes me... I have no one else right now.

So, I'm here, I'm thankful there's a place I can write this down.  I haven't slept today.  I just want the bad and the sad out of my brain.  I don't want to die.  I still want a family and love.  I still want a career and to volunteer.  I just am pretty sure there's too much damage now.  Even if I got out, it would take years to fix me.

One last thing, the other night, I had the most wonderful dreams.  I normally have nightmares but these were dreams filled with vacations with my old friends, a new beginning of romance with someone who actually treated me well, and a conversation with my mom who has always been just out of sight in my dreams since she died last year.  I woke up feeling wonderful and I haven't been able to sleep since then because I'm afraid that the nightmares will take those happy feelings.  I'm fiercely protective of them because it's the first time I felt loved in so very long.

Thank you for listening.  I'm sorry so many of you are hurting too.  If I could take it all away, I would do that for you.  I figure I'm going down anyway, might as well do some good on my way out.  Actually, that reminds me of the first time I considered suicide.  I didn't even have a word for it.  I just remember praying to God, in 1st grade, that he would take me to Heaven and bring another little girl back to her family.  She died of cancer and it made everyone sad and it seemed like she was loved.  I was loved but my family was sick with their problems and the abuse was severe.  At 7, I begged God to barter for what I thought was a better outcome for everyone.  

I guess this is the road I've been on all along.   Fighting it for 30 years didn't make much of a difference, did it?  So, I'm safe, for now.  No plans, no means, but just really exhausted with life.  I'm feeling the burden of every bad choice I've ever made and it's drowning me even though my feet are firmly planted on land.  I don't know if I can dig out.  It's dark down here and there's legitimately no one who I could ask for a rope.

Again, thanks.  Take care.",,Depressed

I'm so sick of knowing that i have to improve and address my problems correctly, but having no motivation to do so. I'm so sick of knowing that I have tests to study for, but I'd rather just sleep and pretend that it doesn't exist. And I'm sick of getting good grades anyways.

But most of all, I'm so sick of not being perfect. I'm so sick of thinking that if I was perfect, maybe things would be all right, that I wouldn't have to deal with all the bullshit that i carry around like a lead weight.

I'm so sick of feeling like I'm the only one that has to deal with these kinds of problems. I'm so sick of feeling like everyone else has their shit straightened out while i'm the only one that doesn't. i'm so sick of feeling left behind with no one to help me get back on my feet

I'm so sick of telling myself that these problems aren't real and i should just get over them like everyone else. I'm so sick of feeling like i'm the only one who can't deal with their struggles and shortcomings. i'm so sick of that pain, and it never goes away.

I know I can be rational and an intelligent person, but I’ve become my own worst enemy.  I’ve lost all inspiration and motivation.  A few weeks ago I was going to forgo all rational preparations and just end it.  I’ve made other posts about what I’m going through.  I was willing to crash my car just so I could die and that is not the death I want.  So, I’ve recently made a pact with myself.  I’m giving it 5 years.  I’m going to try my hardest and persevere.  For myself and my family, and also to prove that I have tried the hardest I can to make life and living work.  However, I can’t do it on my own anymore.  I need someone I can be accountable to, someone I have to be honest with when I can’t be honest with myself.  I do have family and loved ones but my spirit is dark and I cannot bare to put that on them as well.  I also want to allow myself to be anonymous but still open.  My biggest fear is getting help and having these thoughts and feelings used against me, taking away my agency.

Yet I still had a few people from my class following me on instagram.


Back then everyone used to post questions on their stories and I thought it was cool, so I followed suit. 


I did the same thing as them, put on a ""ask me anything"" sticker on my story and: &gt;!no response from anyone!&lt; 


I swear I was so tensed when I saw that. People had seen my story and there were no responses, and if I didn't post any questions I'd get more embarassed further.

"Sociopaths and Psychopaths explained... Sociopath: a sociopath has a huge lack of sympathy, guilt, remorse, shame and fear, however, that doesn't mean they cannot feel happiness, love, compassion and all of the things listed above, but that definitely should never be a sign to sympathize with them. The people they hate the most tend to resemble their past selves, before they turned into sociopaths that is (sociopaths are never born as sociopaths, they grow into being that), for example, person A (sociopath, a theif pre-antisocial mental state) hates person B (non-antisocial, normal person), because B is a simple theif, not necessarily as bad as A, but still a theif, but that doesn't mean that person A is not a theif anymore, infact, they are even worse, but they always despise those who are in the same position as them, which is the backstory of how many sociopaths can be huge hypocrites. Sociopaths are not all the same, some lack more empathy than others, some have more empathy, as it depends on how their life is going in general, as sociopaths tend to be very ungrateful for the things they have, so for example, a poor sociopath most likely would lack more empathy than a rich one, and a sociopath that was bullied in school lacks more empathy than one who didn't get bullied etc. etc.

Psychopaths: a psychopath has a complete lack of sympathy, guilt, remorse, shame and fear, and has absolutely no conscience whatsoever, meaning they have no moral compass to guide them on what is morally correct and what is morally incorrect, so basically, giving a homeless kid a dollar and creating a terrorist group are no different to a psychopath. Pschopaths are different from sociopaths, as they are born psychopaths unlike sociopaths, and psychopaths tend to be incredibly intelligent, while sociopaths tend to have below-average IQ scores.

I have a medical condition that permanently refuses me entry. It's something I've had since birth but it's never stopped me being as active as I want to be in the past, but I can't do that. I'm devastated.. 

Never once have I been unable to do something else because of it, I go to the gym regularly and consider myself fairly healthy so it shouldn't be an issue!

Around a year ago I was about to jump in front of a train. At the time, I was unable to, my legs just wouldn't move. Now, I wish that I had done it. My depression was the worst around August last year, since then I've felt a lot better, which I mostly attribute to the puppy I got in December, but now I'm immediately feeling like there's no point living any more.

"Desperately need helpMy girlfriend is extremely suicidal. She coped with emotional and physical abuse from a parent with mental illness throughout her whole childhood and has attempted suicide extremely often since she was 7 years old.. she had some very crazy and unfortunate things happen to her again this year and it has made her turn back to these thoughts but apparently even worse than before. She hid her feelings from me and has finally come out about it. She tells me her life is painful and she wants to die everyday, thinks about death everyday and often plans a way to commit suicide.. I really worry about her and I try my very best to talk her out of it and tell her I'm here, I love her and so on but it never helps as she says nothing can help her since she's been broken since childhood. She has a period per day of uncontrollable crying and suicidal thoughts. Nowadays she tells me I'm the reason she's still alive and wants me to stop supporting her and she says things things like ""If you let me go I can go back to heaven and my pain will end"" It really hurts me and I'm in tears every single day, she says she doesn't need help and that she doesn't wanna get better and happy, just wants to die. Her family apparently have known about her thoughts and intentions for 10+ years and do not try to stop her from doing it as she says ""they understand my pain"" I really cant believe it and it hurts me even more. When I called her by her name yesterday, she was shocked and told me she feels she is not the same person anymore and that name belongs to a different person, all her stuff is a different persons and she is living in another persons body. I told her this wasn't normal but she insists she's ok and doesn't need help. When I say things will get better she gets very emotional and says ""thats what everyone says, but it just continues to get worse"" ""I have no hope and I'm tired of being alive"". The worst part for me about all this is we're in a long distance relationship and we can't meet up again until August as we are 6000 miles apart.. she goes to counselling on a weekly basis and his asked him things such as ""what is a nice way to kill myself without blood"" but he just listens and doesn't give any advice or support. I tried asking her to go to the hospital ASAP but she ignored me for hours until finally she said she would even though it'll cost her a lot of money. Another thing is she wont promise me that she'll not hurt herself or attempt to hurt herself and it really frightens me.. she just replies with ""but I'm in pain, please understand my feelings"" We're a very close couple and love each other very much. But she still wont have hope for the future or anything I tell her. I really really extremely love her and I wanna support her always and always be there for her.

I smoke weed everyday probably 4-5 times a day. When I’m sober I just hate myself so. Today I realized I was at an actual all time low when I went through the school day today tripping on LSD. It’s funny too cause it’s my first time dropping acid and I did it at school, then in the middle of my physics quiz (which I left blank despite having the answers) I stood up and asked my teacher if I could use the restroom. Went to the bathroom while tripping balls, smoked in there and then came back and then proceeded to hand in my quiz and tell him that I just didn’t know anything on it. Literally a whole unit of work that I missed despite being present in class when it was taught, because my main focus everyday that period was going to the bathroom to smoke weed. Well today when I, never having experienced LSD, dropped acid in school and tripped, not doing any work I completely realized that I don’t give a fuck about my life anymore. My life was a waste to begin with so I’m finally doing my self and everyone else in my environment a favor and throwing it away, by taking it. I figure here would be a good place to leave my final thoughts and words because it’s like a passing of the torch kind of, there’s no one left and there never was anyone to begin with so those who will “claim hurt” by the action of me taking my own life really are just full of shit cause now when I need them they aren’t here so they can go fuck off, So to you, the person reading this, assuming you came here for the same reason I did, good bye.

"Thank you for making 2020 bearable God were to begin? I think we all went through a lot of crap this year. From loved ones dying, to isolation from our friends and family, 2020 was kinda a shit show. I've been suffering from mental illness for the past four or so years, and this year pushed me a lot more than I thought I could handle. My therapist dumped me at the beginning of the year, and I felt so lost. I'd been working with her for two years and some part of me felt like I'd been betrayed. I bounced around a lot between different therapists and programs, and with everything being online, I couldn't really get close enough to anyone to really feel comfortable working with them. 

I started a new school at the beginning of the year. Transferring in your senior year is difficult, especially during a pandemic, when you can't form the same kinds of tight relationships with classmates that you can during in person. I burned a lot of bridges at my old school, and I found myself feeling alone and hopeless. 

The only people I could interact with where my family, and lets be honest, that did not go well. Between the constant arguments and the inability to go out as often as I'd like, I felt suffocated and hopeless. 

When everything is going to hell around you, and there's no one in your life you trust enough to talk to about it, the only option seems like suicide. 

I joined reddit about a year and a half ago. I wasn't on it much, but as I began to spend more time out home, I started to spend more time on reddit. I joined r/teenagers maybe two months ago, and I started posting. I didn't get a whole lot of interaction on my posts, but the interaction that I got was enough to help me get through this shitty year. I messaged other redditors, got added to discords, commented on posts, and it helped to remind me that the world is not as small as it seems. I am not alone. None of us are ever truly alone, it's just a matter of finding the right communities to join. 

Thank you for getting me through this year, and for giving me something to live for. Here's to a less shitty 2020.

Love,

"I just found out the worst news of my life I’ll start off by saying I’m a 13 year old female.

So I had this friend for years, almost going on 4 years. They’ve been one of my bestest friends ever. They were so kind, caring, they really were great. Today I got a text earlier from them saying that they are gonna kill themselves, I’ve always been the one to help them, they made me want to become a psychologist so I tried my usual, then I tried even harder, and harder, by then I’ve tried everything to convince them that there is a way out, but they didn’t listen. Now they blocked me, and I’m assuming they died by now of overdose. Just saying that doesn’t feel real, none of this feels real, I feel like I’m in a horrible dream but no matter what I can’t wake up, I just can’t!! 

They inspired me to do so much, they meant so much to me, truly they did.
But now they’re dead, they died hating my guts, they died thinking there wasn’t a way out, they died thinking no one would care, but I care and I care so much I’ve just decided to quit doing the things they inspired me to do.
I’m just gonna quit art for god knows how long, I’m never gonna become a psychologist (I’ve helped so many people and this was the first person who just ended it, ended it all) 

I don’t even know what I’m gonna do with my life, I thought last weekend life was gonna go uphill from here, but it just plummeted. 

I just want to die honestly, I can’t stand death and I don’t know what I’m gonna do from here. I won’t kill myself because I don’t want to put my girlfriend through the things my friend has put me through, honestly she’s probably worried sick because I haven’t messaged her since before I just balled my eyes out, I cried, and cried, and I’m crying while writing this. 

If you’re wondering, I can’t do anything to help, we were only online friends so I never found out their address, I tried to search for their school but no luck. I just hope they are okay and not dead but they probably are dead.

I just needed a place to type my feelings out in.

Worst case scenario, I get it when I'm 20. I hate my smile so much. It's one of my biggest insecurities, and it isn't going to be fixed until I'm 18 at best.

Mostly a lot of people giving up, maybe reaching out that one last time for validation in the hopes they won't have to go through with it, or if they do, it means something.

Sometimes i try to help, ask the while thinking I'm just a liar, hoping that good deed will convince me not to take my own life, repeating arguments said to me, or imparting experiences I've had hoping there's something in there that will remind me to keep going you a little while longer till the pain passes.

But mine doesn't really pass, not because there wasn't hope or things that could have helped, but because I ignored them when it mattered and now, with the combination of long term suffering and a painful situation i couldn't possibly begin to cope with, I don't have enough in me to drag myself out of this hole one more time.

Add in the grind of age, and it feels like it's time.

"Need advice for crush I’ve never met. 17F and a Senior in HS  :) 

I’m currently needing some advice for a friendship/relationship that I don’t know how to progress.

I met this guy during zoom meetings and asked for his socials to talk about the subject in class. 

I was ULTIMATELY captured by his looks and how he talks. 

He’s very smart as well considering we were in the same AP class. 

At the time, I only wanted to be friends and was interested in what he thought about the class. But we started to text more and more about each other. 

He mainly talks about himself and never asks me questions but I enjoy our conversations online. I’m usually the one to start the conversations as well. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m annoying the guy since I’m constantly texting him, not the other way around. 

I also feel like I’m forcing the conversations onto him. 

I don’t think he’s one to call (I don’t have his number I’m fairly scared to ask) plus I think it’d be weird since we haven’t even met in person. 

Due to covid, we can’t really see each other and I’m currently in a different state as I had to travel to visit family (don’t worry i had my mask on at all times) 

I also transferred schools in the same city so talking about our class is out the window.

"I am stupid, useless, and evil and I want to die.Firstly, I would like to say that I was not abused as a child in any way, and have had as loving a family as anyone could ask for.  I am in my 20's and am male.

I don't know what is wrong with me.  One of my first childhood memories was of stealing a toy from someone's locker in preschool.  As a kid, I shoplifted and was never caught.  I have since stopped, but likely only out of fear of getting caught in this camera-obsessed world.

I am insecure, vengeful, and filled with hate.  I do not usually let these feelings show, but they have affected the way I interact with people, particularly with friends.  I do not make friends easily, but lose them quickly when they spend enough time to realize what I am hiding from them.

I have a girlfriend who has been perfect to me yet whom I do not trust due to her past sexual relationships.  I feel like I am hiding my real personality from her.  I feel that she deserves better than me.  And she really does.

I am stupid.  I have a college degree but it means nothing except that I am able to take exams without understanding actual concepts.  I don't feel like I am able to learn anything.

I am useless.  Looking for a job has been fruitless.  Because I am stupid, nobody will hire me because I am terrible at what I do.  But all this might be ok if I could be happy with who I am.  However:

I am evil.  I have had a history of animal abuse since I was a kid.  I have done many things which I regret now, but was compelled to do as a kid.  I have beaten a neighbor's dog, abused and possibly murdered kittens found in a box left at the park, shot squirrels/birds with BB guns, and electrocuted a lizard I found outside.  I don't know why I have urges to do these things.  And I hate myself for it.  I am sure after reading this paragraph, you now hate me as well, which I certainly deserve.  Yet, recently I have done much worse.

My girlfriend and I obtained a small pet together, which I have now murdered.  Attempting to train it not to bite in exactly the wrong way (physical punishment), I punished it and punished it until it led to its death.  I watched with a cold heart full of rage as the life drained from its tiny eyes.  This I will never forget.  I lied to my girlfriend about the circumstances of its death.

I want to die.  As a teenager, I had always thought about suicide, but never got further than holding a knife tip against my heart.  Distractions in life and thoughts that I could change into a good person brought those thoughts further from me as I got older.  Now, it is clear to me that I am inherently evil and don't deserve life.  Surely you agree?

I have always wondered about the villains in stories and how they got to that point in their lives.  They make bad decisions to get to where they end up, but how much of it is predetermined at their birth?  Do they consciously decide to be evil, or does circumstance lead them to that path?

I am not sure why I'm posting this.  I am not religious so maybe this is a way to confess my sins to a community I trust.  If this is somehow traced back to me and leads to action against me, then all the better.  I know I deserve it.  In the meantime, all I can think about is how I should do everyone a favor and rid myself from this world.",,Depressed

"girl jumps in bhopal shahpura lake with her laptoplast month,in April 2019,in bhopal city of madhya pradesh India,a body was recovered inside a tourist attraction,Lake shahpura.
she was recovered after 5 days of missing report being filed by her family.her laptop was also recovered along with her,that made it more suspecious for the people of that locality.
upon intterogation with her family,it was discovered that she was in a bad mental state from last few days,but never disclosed anything upon asking,she had cutoff from her friends and also was not eating food from last few days.she never left her laptop during this time and used to stare at it for hours at a singke sitting.
upon asking in her locality,no one had any clue about this.she was a ranker in her college and always topped in her class.
also from last few days,there are reports of sighting of a strange figure that looks like a girl using her computer in different localities of bhopal,most sightings reported near mp nagar,shahpura,kolar road and ashoka garden,there are talks about that being a ghost of that girl.sightings are increasing daily and more reports have started to come in.some people who reported multiple sightings, mentioned that they usually see her on the first floor of buildings specially balcony and doors who had openings outside buildings but on first floor only.
these facts were confirmed by other people who reported this sightings.
some people are reported to suffer through a trauma because of this and others have stopped leaving their house after 12 in night,the time during which she is usually sighted.
the cause of her suicide still remains a mystery as there is no statement to support this fact.and as the days are passing by,the ghost with a computer us becoming a prevelent belief in those areas,even some police officials have also confirmed to have sighted such figures,it it turns into a doll if observed very closely.in some reports it also disappered in just a blink.
no reports have came up to confirm any losses or harmful actions of that ghost.but the people who suffered)suffering from the trauma,explained that she tried to explain some things to them through her hands and others say that they usually see her in her dreams during their sleep in the morning.

"I just can't keep this up anymore...My main problem is that I over analyze things. I haven't reached out for help because I feel like I can figure out my problems. This hasn't worked, so here I am.

I am currently 22/f. When I was 18, I graduated high school and moved in with my boyfriend before college. We moved to a new are where I didn't have any friends. With work, class, and comuting via bus, I didn't feel like I had time to make friends. 

I get along great with everyone. I just didn't make any of my own friends. In my sophomore year, I started seeing the college psychologist. He made me feel a bit better. After a couple if months, I quit showing up to class and missed a lot. I struggled so much, I ended up dropping out due to mental health issues.

After dropping out, I applied to my current job. I love my job and I make decent money. I still live with the boy I moved in with; he's my fiancé now! I feel like my life sounds good on paper, but  not happy. 

My fiancé has some great friends. They all say they are my friends as well. I find this hard to imagine because nobody ever goes out of their way to talk to me or invite me to things. I also feel like my fiancé has been too distracted to pay any attention to me. I honestly feel like nobody wants anything to do with me. I feel so lonely - even when I'm surrounded by people.

I'm trying to make everyone like me or want to be around me. I'm trying to take interest in the things they like. I hope by doing this, they will want to talk to me more. Is this the right approach? Or am I just crazy?? I've never had real interests of my own.. I guess I've always picked up what others like so that they'll like me.

Since I've never had my own interests, I don't know what I like. I feel like I should pick up a hobby to distract myself from my loneliness and depression. What should I do? What would I like?

Another thing that has been keeping me down is my boss. I have made mistakes at work that have had her frustrated with me. I totally get being annoyed or even upset with me. But anymore, she ignores me and wants nothing to do with me. I ask questions trying to learn about things and I can't even get a straight answer out of her. When she does talk to me, it is to belittle me in front of the entire office. This makes the whole office uncomfortable and then nobody will speak to me. It is hard to go somewhere every day when you don't feel like anyone wants you there.

After coming home from work, I make sure that I try to keep up with the house. My fiancé has friends over pretty often and they can make a mess. I feel like nobody respects me because they do not clean up after themselves. My fiancé has had his hours cut at work. I know he is in a funk right now and doesn't feel like doing anything.. But I wish he would help me out. I've even picked Up a second job. I try my best to do everything to take care of him! Even the little things I do for him - pick him up movies and snacks he likes, rub his back, talk about things he likes.. Sometimes I feel like I don't receive the same treatment.

To top off all of the negative feelings I have regarding my relationships in my life, I feel pretty useless. I strive to be the best at work and in my personal life. Well, at work, I'm pretty average. In my personal life, I'm pretty average. I don't have any hobbies or anything that I'm good at. I'm 22 years old and I have no drivers license. So, I'm completely dependent on others. This makes me feel terrible.

For those of you that have read this, thank you. I just needed to vent and had no idea where to go. I contemplate suicide all of the time, but I don't want to let someone down by having them deal with that. I apologize for the rant and spelling/ formatting issues.

"My repressed ex-religious ass got hugged by a stranger on a dare and I've never felt better than this before To set the stage I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness, in a cult that controls ones ability to make friends outside of the religion and sexually represses it's members (along with covering up child abuse and other terrible stuff). This has given me social anxiety and low self worth even after ""waking up"" from their ideology. So when this happened it really affected me.

I was coming down an escalator and a girl (slightly younger than me) scampered forward from her group of giggling friends and hugged me awkwardly as I walked off the bottom of the escalator, quickly then running back to her group.

I was really flattered that I was the guy they dared the girl to hug. I jumped to the conclusion that she had said she thought I was cute or something and the others had then pressured her into doing it (although that is definitely reading into it a bit too much). It's not that I was attracted to the girl (I barely had time to see her face and I think she was younger than me) it's just that I have been so completely starved of validation that that tiny bit made me feel more fucking confident than I have been in ages. 

Fellow teenagers. Compliment your friends. Especially guys. They are so often struggling with low self esteem and a bit of external support can do miracles (but don't hug people right now with COVID and all)

"Got in trouble for my resting face when I was in grade 8 (story) This is pretty long but I figured people would find this somewhat interesting. Typed this pretty quickly so sorry for spelling errors and such. 

Im now in grade 11 and have been 4 schools in total. I know for a fact that where this story comes from is actually the worst school I have ever been apart of. 

So every year we had this thing that was pretty common among schools. Typically near the last block or 2 of the day a basketball game was organized (teachers vs students)  and all of the grade 6, 7, and 8 students were invited to watch. I always thought that being there was pretty shitty especially because sports dont interest me much and I was always behind in grade 8 so it pissed me off a little that I wasn't allowed to stay behind and work on some due assignments. 

So one year in particular a friend of mine was on their phone beside me looking at memes awhile trying to show me. We weren't supposed to have our phones (for whatever reason) and so I was a bit nervous he would get caught. I told him to make a better effort in hiding it so he doesn't get the thing taken away from him and he does try at first to make it less obvious but subconsciously went back to being on it causally. 

I had my drawing book with me at the time (I was only allowed to have it because it helped with anxiety) and was sketching something. Suddenly I heard a teacher from the bottom of the bleachers say ""put your shit away!"" (Wasnt uncommon in this school for teachers to cus but if a kid did it you got sent home) and thinking she was talking to me, I looked up  and glanced at the teacher. I realized she was talking to my friend and so went back to drawing. 

I look back up again not even 2 minutes later and see shes suddenly staring at me. A bit freaked out I tried going back to drawing but I was aware of the teacher watching me in the corner of my eye. Suddenly I heard my name being called by her. I didnt think I was on trouble so I came down smiling and asked her what was up. She told me to sit at the front of the bleachers and the fallowing conversation happend, 

Me: huh? Why? 

Teach: You were glaring at me. Do you understand how rude that is!? 

Me: glaring?? I looked at you for a second thinking you were talking to me earlier! 

I got pretty defensive and we went back and forth. I kept trying to tell her its my resting face, and I can look pretty intense when drawing even a simple sketch because im focused. She refused to believe me and instead sent me to the office for ""making excuses"".  

I go without question and she doesn't fallow after me right away. When I arrive there the office lady asked me why I was sent there and I attempted to explain my unfair situation. But before she could respond the teacher who sent me there showed back up and grabbed my wrist borderline throwing me into an empty office just to yell at me. 

We loudly went back and forth. Through I was trying not to yell I still kinda did since I was starting to panic after being yelled at for somthing I can't really control. Not to mention that I have anxiety ticks that caused me to start twitching while agruing which only got her more mad and accused me for faking and trying to get out of the situation without apologizing. Eventually I scream ""I'm sorry"" and ask her if I can finally leave. Yet she doesn't let me because my apology ""wasn't a real apology"". 

She then threatened to call my mother if I didn't give her a proper and calm response detailing why I apparently glared at her and to stop twitching.

I saw an opportunity to get out of the situation so I continued to refuse forcing her to call my mom hoping my mom could somehow help. It only got worse from there as she tried telling my mom I glared at her after she told me to put my phone away. That was a mistake to say since I didn't have a phone with me and that it was still in my moms car which she happened to be in during the call. My mom told her this information and asked if shes sure I glared and didn't just have a resting bitch face. 

Seriously this went on forever, the teacher continued to agrue with her as if she knew me better saying that she taught my grade 6 class and that she ""knew that look"". my mom eventually had enough and told her she was going to pick me up from school and to let me get my stuff together. She tried keeping me there but an office lady who could hear the teacher on the phone (by listening using the other phone in the office) told her she legally wasn't allowed and to let me get my stuff together.

It doesn't have to be some big grand thing... I just want them to go ""Hey"" instead of ""You're pathetic"".

Why do people tske every opportunity to be cruel to me... i just dont understand. These are people who ive been their friend through all kinds of shit. But it doesnt matter... when its me... i dont matter. They'll never treat me how i want them to treat me... i just want to matter to them like they matter to me. I just want them to be the bare minimum nice. They dont have to love or like me... just dont choose the cruel option.

I cant go back. Im just so broken. Im too exhausted to try and get better. Its been such a shit year. With people just making me feel shit. Just continuous fighting. Being told I'm not good enough. Having to hear about ex girlfriends getting married and how great their life is and reminisce about times they cheated on me and its all fun and games to them because they dont care and they never cared... but i just dont get it. Who calls an ex to tell them they're getting married? What did they expect? How can it be anything but  an attempt to hurt someone? Do my exes just have so little care factor for me that they can be shitty without a second thought? Id never in a million years go ""Hey, im having problems with the person I cheated on you with and destroyed your entire trust in relationships... can I vent to you?"" - am I just dumb? It doesnt matter what i do they hate me enough to do shit like that and literally not see a problem with it. If i complain they dont care enough to fix it... they just get a sick sense of happiness they've hurt me... I dont get it.

Why are people so cruel? I have no alternative. I can't change my mind because if I do everyone will just be cruel about it. Yet I still seek their love. I want the people who hate me to love me. Anybody who does genuinely care for me... it doesn't hit the same. Everything has gone so wrong.",,Depressed

Like I am not really anything important , people won’t talk to me unless they are forced too . Because they just don’t care about me 

So I made a friend /gf up , I’d like to say she’s more of a friend than a gf 
But it’s also a girl so it’s a girlfriend at some rate 
I tend to imagine I world where I talk to her , and I just live happily , 
And I know I don’t have to worry about my appearance , because I know she would love me either way 
The problem is I feel like I am lying  to myself ,  because I have super high expectations , and then I go back to my life and there is no way anything like that is ever happing , I try to talk to my old friends , nothing , I try to be happy ,nothing 

I just have one plan left ,but I don’t know if I like it ,because if it fails it fails catastrophically , moving to another place /school/country 
If there is no one in my school that gives a fuck about me , maybe they would in some other school , maybe if I find another girl like me , she can be my girlfriend , but I am setting some super high standards on me , especially when you look  how shitty I am 

Here are my standards so you can judge 

-be at least quite cute  , 
- have a sense of humor , the more it fits with mine the better we bond 
-have something in common with me , the more things the better 
-be a little mature , like don’t be one of this Tiktok girls  that feel like robots
 And just do anything to fit the norm , because I am the furthest thing from the norm , so then you just wouldn’t like me 
-but also be a little silly , and fun , and sweet 

This is really a lie , I have quite high standards of beauty 
Like for example (not trying to be racist by any way )
I don’t feel attracted to black people , or even like tanned 
Sorry if I offended anyone but I don’t , 
Uh actually I think that it , damm I sound really racist , 

I actually found this girl once (the girl I talked at the begging )  but she changed school and although I try to talk to her it’s not the same 
So that is my rant ,

"Recently saw a friend attempt. It's brought back a lot of memories of my own attempts and I'm back in that place again.I have a fairly long history of nearly constant suicidal ideation (ages 10 to 28) and a number of serious suicide attempts in that time. 
I survived all that, somehow and for the last 2 years, I've been actually ""pretty good"", it was about a year ago I realized that I hadn't thought of ending my life once in the prior week and that was an incredibly satisfying realization. 

I don't think I've ever been completely free of this, but there is a difference between ""my life, sucks, I should end it"" once a week and constantly planning / searching for methods that takes over my life. 

But a few weeks back, I saw a friend attempt, stopped it, took them to the ER, stayed with them during intake and visited them quite a bit while they were housed in inpatient. 

For most of it, I was thinking that I should be the one that was locked up and I kept on walking up to the nurse's station, wanting to tell them they should hold me, but I couldn't find the guts to do it. 

After we left the hospital, I had a bit of a breakdown. I kept a fairly decent ""I'm ok"" face on, but underneath, I'm a complete mess. The ideation and searching for methods has come back and there has been a fair amount very intense depersonalization as well, the strength of which is new - as well as immense issues with concentration and a feeling of falling if I'm not moving.  

Anyone else go through a similar experience? Any advice?",,Depressed

"Been feeling sad for about 2 years now.Hello there, I  guess I can start with an introduction. I'm 15, just starting my second year in high school. (I know a kid like me shouldn't have much to complain about, but everyone has some problems right?) Most of my years when I was a kid I was that one kid who just stayed home playing single-player video games all by himself and had maybe one or two friends. At the time I didn't really care because I was just a small kid. As the years went on I noticed I was the kind of kid nobody cares about or who would just compare themselves to me just for a good laugh. Eventually I started being more social, and making more friends. I was the friend you would talk to at school, but you would never hang out with them. I didn't care though. I was so happy, I hardly had friends and the few people who were my friends were mean to me. Even if I only talked to them in school at lunch or between classes, I was filled with joy for the sake that people enjoyed talking to me! I starting being even more social and talking to many people and they were nice to me, it was a whole new world I never knew, and before I knew it I started hanging out with those friends. I was so happy, and I even enjoyed talking to other people who were sad. It made me happy seeing other people happy! Eventually I calmed down a bit and it felt normal having these friends, but there was nothing to be sad about. One day out of nowhere I just felt like it was hard to talk to make, I couldn't make eye contact and it was hard to help other people with their problems. I didn't know what was going on, but I started becoming very sad. I noticed more and more that it was hard to talk to anyone who wasn't my close friend. From there on I started picking back up bad habits like constantly keeping my hood on at all times to avoid attention from people. Then it started escalating really fast. It was hard to walk around other people, I felt like they were watching me and I sometimes forgot how to walk properly. (I know it sounds stupid, but I'm serious) Whenever I heard someone laugh around me I felt as if they were laughing at me, I didn't even like people bumping into me or touching me. I started hating everyone, I felt like I was going crazy. I someone bumped into me I thought in my head ""Bump into me again, and I will make sure you die slowly."" Whenever I saw people happy it made me angry for some reason. And I questioned the things I was saying and I didn't know what to think anymore. The only times I truly laugh now is when I am around my close friends. Sometimes when I look at them I forget that they are my friends because I always look back at the times when nobody liked me. Not only was I sad I started becoming suicidal. I spent all day in class thinking about how I could use the equipment in the class to kill myself and I daydreamed about if I was different in a better way. I now I notice people are treating me like some person who just moved into the school from a foreign country and talk to me like I can't even speak English. On my 14th birthday my dad took me out to go shoot a gun for the first time, and I thought to myself it was my golden opportunity to kill myself. Of course i couldn't do it because they didn't keep their eye on me and I felt as if they would stop me and it wouldn't go well after that. After that I kept poking myself with knives to see how much force it would take to actually have the blade dig in my skin. I use to try my best to be socially active whenever I got the chance. Now all I do is spend my time sitting in my basement watching anime or sitting down looking at the floor with my hood up. (I believe that my hood keeps me safe, as dumb as it sounds) I feel like if I lose my friends I will lose everything. They are honestly the only people who can make me happy. Please Reddit can you help? My situation may not seem like much, but I feel so sad every day and I don't want my friends to worry about me. I honestly think I am going insane, I don't know what I am thinking anymore. Also, if you actually took the time to read this then thank you.",,Depressed

I work a part time job I hate and suck at.  was supposed to graduate college, but that's not happening for a while now, and to be honest I don't really care.  Never had a girlfriend, not a real relationship at least.  Still a virgin at 21.  Don't ask girls out much, but I recently started to.  Both were taken, as it seems everyone is. Everyone's got somebody, but not me. The past week I reconnected with an internet friend of mine who I used to be close with.  We've been talking all day and sexting at night.  Out of nowhere she said she wants to stop the sexual stuff.  That's not the problem, Im just afraid we'll stop talking.  She was the only person I've had to talk to outside of my three guy friends in months... years. I'm trying not to be upset about it cause it's someone I'm never gonna meet and it's someone I went five years without talking to, but seriously... just like that?  Why can't anything ever go right or at least end smoothly in my life?  I don't see a scenario where I don't kill myself one day.  I'm tired of being lonely every fucking minute of my life.  I know someone will offer to talk to me but it's just not the same.  I haven't felt physical and mutual affection in close to five years now.  It hasn't gotten easier and I don't think it ever will.

"I hate my life.I'm 20 years old and my life sucks. I got a perfect ACT score, I go to a top 20 college on full scholarship, I know 5 languages, I'm learning to program, I've read every book in the Western canon, I do freelance translation work on the internet (because I can't fucking stand ""real"" jobs) and everyone who's ever met me is convinced I'm a genius.

But it doesn't matter. I fucking hate my life. I hate myself. Nothing goes right. I have a thousand fucking accomplishments and it just doesn't make me happy because I get NOTHING from all my hard work. I've tried approaching women and every single time they just tell me I'm disgusting. I posted on r/amiugly and I got a lukewarm response (ranging ""you're cute"" [not ""you're hot""] to ""you're ugly"" or ""your hair looks stupid"" or ""go to this malefashion reddit, it'll make you look better"", because apparently the way I am right now just isn't fucking good enough). I try to go to parties and bullshit like that where it's supposed to be easy to pick up chicks and I'm just rejected every. single. time. Even if I make any god damn progress the second I admit I'm still a virgin at my age everyone is disgusted because I'm the god damn odd man out who didn't spend his high school years looking for nothing but god damn poo-tang. It's a fucking catch-22 where I can't get laid because I haven't gotten laid, and you know what, I KNOW that part of my problem is that my confidence is blown to shit because I'm so worried about the fact that I still haven't gotten laid, but recognizing that fact DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY. I still have no fucking confidence, so no one is remotely attracted to me, so no one will fucking let me near them,

I can't get along with anyone. No one in my group of ""friends"" shares any of my beliefs, and I only maintain these relationships because they're the only people I have that I can have any sort of sustained social contact with, but I HATE EVERYONE IN MY LIFE. My entire family is religious, racist, bigoted, and ignorant, and I hate them. Same with everyone in my group of ""friends"". I hang out with one of my old friends from high school and he talks about how he hates niggers and wishes his 15 year old girlfriend would put out as easy as the other girls he's fucked and dumped. I hang out with my half-brother and we smoke but then he starts talking about how he hates niggers and hates Obama and hates wetbacks and I try my best to look past his flaws but he's just a disgusting human being. Every single person I have any sort of social connection with is disgusting because I grew up in a heavily religious rural poor part of the country. I've tried looking for new friends and new minds who I might jive with better but I just fail every single time. No one wants anything to do with me, so I just cling on to all these people I hate just so I'm not quite so terribly alone. I can either have company I hate or no company at all. My brother thinks I'm a pain in the ass, my cousins just put up with me because they have to, my Dad hates me because I called the cops on him when he hit my Mom, my Mom tries to support me but she's religious and can't understand the reasons for anything I do. No one in my life really likes me and I just put on this fucking mask every single time I talk to anyone and I feel like I'm the biggest god damn liar on the planet, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A LIAR BUT IT'S EITHER THAT OR THROW MYSELF ON THE STREET TO ROT. I can't even commit suicide because I don't want to hurt my family because I know they still love me even if they don't understand me, but I can't fucking live like this pretending to be someone I'm not. If I told them I'm bisexual and an atheist and a communist and I translate Japanese porn for a living, I'd be disowned on the spot, but I have nowhere to go if I don't keep hiding it from them because I don't make nearly enough to actually support myself.

This year I ended up taking medical leave from college for my depression and anxiety but my readmission to college is contingent on my recovery, which means I'm not even allowed to tell my therapist that the drugs don't do SHIT for me and I still feel like killing myself because if I don't ""recover"" (like you can FUCKING RECOVER FROM THIS, like there's some GOD DAMN MIRACLE CURE that can make my life not a gigantic smelly piece of ass) before fall semester starts I'll be kicked out of the college and have to reapply for admission, which I know I won't be re-accepted because of my shitty grades in my first year. I'm just trapped and I have no one I can talk to about my real problems because if I do I'LL GET FUCKED AND MY LIFE WILL BE RUINED EVEN WORSE THAN IT IS. That's how fucked my entire situation is. I even have to lie and put on a bullshit face for my god damn therapist because my school will fuck my life over if I don't. I don't have a fucking run of the mill ""moody teenager going through depression"" problem that some bullshit ""talk about your problems"" therapy will fix in 18 one-hour meetings, and because of that I don't fucking deserve my scholarship I guess???

Every single fucking day I just try to distract myself and stop myself from feeling the pain, hoping I can get through this for the next 6 months and then things will get better once I'm not under the gun any time I show anyone that I still fucking feel like killing myself, but I just can't. I have no outlet. There's fucking nothing. I try to pacify myself with weed, but it just makes the time go by, it doesn't fucking stop me from feeling the pain two hours later once I come down. I try to stick to the Paxil and be a good boy in the hopes that the stupid happy pills will actually work BUT THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T WORK. NONE OF THE FUCKING HAPPY PILLS WORK. FUCK ZOLOFT. FUCK PAXIL. FUCK XANAX. YOUR SHITTY PILLS ARE SNAKE OIL. WHAT I NEED IS SOMEONE WHO WILL ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM.

But no, everyone just tells me fuck you, get away from me the second I reveal even the slightest facet of who I really am. The second I told people in high school I was atheist all my ""friends"" pretty much disappeared. The second my family got the slightest whiff that I was translating unseemly things to make some damn money, I was suddenly demoted within this invisible hierarchy, like the god damn stepkid who gets the shitty room hidden under the staircase. I don't ask for that fucking much, I just want to live my own god damn life without people telling me my life, my beliefs, my hobbies, my existence is wrong. Is it so fucking bad that I want someone to love me? No, I'm not like you. Maybe I'm not like anyone. I've given up on trying to find fucking ""common ground"", but if I can fucking accept them even though they're so radically different from me, WHY CAN'T THEY ACCEPT ME? Why am I the fucking pariah? Why am I excluded from everything? My entire fucking life is just sitting on the computer looking for shit to distract me from my terrible life, and if I'm not on the computer, I'm sleeping. That's what I fucking do with my life. I sleep. I sleep 12 hours a day. Sometimes more. Because what the fuck else am I supposed to do? Go outside? And do FUCKING WHAT? No one wants anything to do with me. I can walk around and get stares if anyone recognizes me for the god damn freak I am, not like I have any real god damn friends to hang out with. I have maybe three people who I would ever hang out with outside the house, and I can tell that to every single one of them I'm their last choice, the fucking loser who they call up when they have no one else to hang out with, or when they need me to do something for them, or when they need me to get weed for them, or when they want their fucking xanax fix. That's what I am to them. Because even my friends don't fucking like me, they tolerate me.

So what do I do? Just what on God's green motherfucking earth do I do? I can either live a lie for the next 6 months, then go back to college and live a lie again until maybe I find someone else who's completely fucked like me and we can maybe halfway get along, or I can just kill myself and make everyone who's put so much effort into keeping me going pissed and miserable. There's no fucking way for my life to end happily. Either I take the pain or someone else does. I know so damn well that if I kill myself my Mom will cry and cry and cry for years and I know she loves me but I'm just such an *other* that even now she doesn't REALLY understand just what she sired. I don't want to do that to her, or anyone else in my fucking life, even if I do hate them, I can't fucking do that to so many people, but I just don't want to fucking live. The best way to describe it is I am so incredibly fatigued. Spiritually fatigued. If you've ever really enjoyed something and done it for hours on end, but then gotten tired of it after so long, you know what fatigue feels like. To me, life is like that. I used to like life. I really did. Now I'm just tired of it. I wish there was some other existence my life could have, something OTHER THAN LIFE. I don't want to end it, I just want a real break. I wish I could go to sleep for a thousand years and dream and dream and dream and wake up, and then after all that time maybe I'd be ready to face all this incredible bullshit, but right now I just need a long, long break from all this. It's too much for me. I'm such a weak person and everyone is asking me to shoulder such an incredible burden, and they all act like it's an easy thing to do. I'm constantly told that my life is easy, I'm not working, what do I have to complain about? I HAVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FACT THAT MY LIFE IS EMPTY. THERE IS NOTHING IN MY LIFE. THERE IS ONLY THAT GREAT, PRESSING BURDEN, CRUSHING ME FROM ALL ANGLES, AND THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS IGNORE IT. I'm just supposed to ignore it, because no one else can see it.

"Sinking FeelingMy girlfriend left me. 

I'd always felt like a waste. I had gotten expelled back in middle school and that's when I first tried to take my own life. I couldn't swallow pills easily and ended up not taking anywhere near enough to hurt myself. I wailed and smacked my head against the floor which finally made me unconscious. No one knew, except my brother who had found the note I left. A page of scrabbling I shoved under the couch I wanted to die on.

Highschool was an odd time. I'd spent most of it eating lunch alone in the stairwells. I was a horrible student with no motivation. Every week I wanted to just die. I got arrested while being a menace with my only friend. His parents forbade him from seeing me, and I became truly alone.

I tried breaking out, joined the schools football and rugby team. I went from being denied in my freshman year to starter in senior and junior. I don't talk to anyone on those teams anymore. I never went to the parties, and except for an athletic award, there's no way for me to remember those years. No one ever took a picture of me.My parents never came to game. 

I became cynical. I faked who I was and played the cool cat. Feel into drugs. Drove drunk and high more times than I care to admit. I'd drive my fathers motorcycle at near 200km/h on hilly roads out in the countryside, with  no regard for myself or others. I'd sometimes close my eyes and hope that I'd be veering off course. I couldn't do it.

I'd break down crying pretty often. Just randomly while doing things. I couldn't explain it. Sometimes I'd look in the mirror and notice myself frowning intensely and tearing up. It hurt in a way I can't describe and couldn't feel. 

University rolled around. I was getting high everyday, or every other day. I failed out of my program after the first semester. 

Ah, this is all side garbage. My current girlfriend, or ex.. she was introduced to me through a friend. She'd have him up in her room, late at night. Her floormates would tease her about locked her door all the time. That friend told me they'd bang.

I'd begun to lose weight. I went from 235 to my current 170 over these past few year. I'd think love from someone would mean something. She yelled at him publically, telling me, who she confided in, (she actually had never once asked me about my life, or how I was feeling. She just used me to talk to and get to him)

"What else can I do? I've never been so worried.In the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, my brother (who turned 18 a week ago) was admitted to a ""Behavioral Health"" facility for attempting to commit suicide. I stayed at the hospital with him for about 5 hours until they transferred him from the ER we were in to the other facility. Since then, none of my family members or I have heard from him. The only reason I know that he is even there is a text I got from him as soon as he arrived. 

Also, my dad got a phone call from a physiatrist there, and when he answered all she said was that they were looking for a family member of my brother's. When he identified himself as my dad, the lady said ""Oh, I was looking for his sister"" and hung up on him. She called me and was asking lots of weird questions about how many pills he told me he took ect. The weirdest part was she asked ""Well, how is he doing now?"" I informed her that I hadn't talked to him. She immediately said ""I'll call you back"" and hung up. I never received a call back. 
My mom called the facility and they can't even confirm if he's a patient there or not. If I hadn't been in the hospital room with him at that exact moment they said the name of the place I would have no idea where he is.

I guess my questions are: Is it possible they aren't LETTING him call us? Or is this more likely his choice? Why would a doctor call me and my dad but not really explain anything to us? I know he's 18, but he's a senior in high school and still very dependent. Is there anything else I can do or anyone I can call to see if he's okay? I know 72 hours is customary, will they just kick him out the front door if they think he's ready to go home? ",,Depressed

"Seeing an escort made me suicidal againI was doing OK for a few months I still has not problems but I coped well. I turned 18 recently and I did the usual stuff like buying lots of weed and alcohol with my inheritance money I finally got access to. On top of that I figured visiting an escort might be fun because it's legal in my country so I figured that people have casual sex all the time so it must be fun without any emotional connection.

I was absolutely devasted in hindsight by not true that was. I mean there's is no emotional connection but the interactions are genuine. For example when I said I'm kinda shy and how she instantly changed her way of talking and comforted me I figured she could easily get away by also not doing that. I thought it was going to be just pleasure like in porn or something but it was a lot of caring by kissing and saying stuff like I'm in a safe place and goddamn that's right and it's the most brutal thing. The whole thing was made so much worse by how clearly she did care about my psychological needs. 

It was the most thoughtful, caring and understanding way another person has ever interacted with me and that's devastating.

all day long

my soul feels defeated

like it has been stepped on

&amp;#x200B;

and the person stepping on it

hasn't gotten off

I'm stuck to the ground

where my life belongs

&amp;#x200B;

cause I'm too meaningless

to be someone important

I'm too weak

to feel a sense of worthfulness

I just take up space

and air and breath and food

I waste my parent's money

but this is nothing new

and it doesn't mean a thing

to spend money on their daughter

but still, I amount to nothing

I know they're talking about me

and how I'm always alone

and a so-called ""wanna be""

I haven't had the energy to remove from my fingers

have the teacher assign me to a group

when no one wants to work with me

am I really that bad?

I silently think

as the tears begin to form

and my soul begins to shrink

the next class I had was math

I feel so stupid in that class

I don't do the homework

and pray to God somehow I'll pass

ignore all the lessons

start to fall behind

every thought is a distraction

it's like a prison in my mind

but then I had to go to bed

woke up forgetting everything

the characters said

"I'veGotNoPersonality checkkk Since I'm a little kid I've shown signs of being more academically advanced than my classmates, and that would often make adults tell me ""oh, you are so smart"". That ended up building the idea on my mind that in order to be smart you had to be more advanced than the rest of your classmates, but also, that being smart was the only good feature of mine, and that's why, in a sort of way, I needed to be the smartest (which meant, the most advanced kid in the class).
That's the reason why I've always been obsessed with school, and why I saw grades as a competition (and would feel awful when someone was better than me). 
At this point of my life, school's more difficult, and it's starting to be a problem that thing of being ""smarter"" than the rest. I'm incredibly afraid of failure, which drives me to procrastinate, so that way, I don't fail, and nobody """"""""""notices"""""""""" that I'm not """"""""""smart"""""""""""" anymore. I have to admit, one of the things that terrifies me the most is that all this time I've been obsessed with school, because, for me, being smart was part of my personality. That obsession didn't let me focus on other things that I liked. So now, I have to face the truth: 
I'm not the smartest kid in my class. I won't ever be. Being smart is not part of my personality, because I'm not smart. And since that was the only thing included in my personality, that means that I've got no personality. And I hate this lack of personality.",,Anxious

I don’t know if it’s a well know thing but we would just try to kick a rock in between our legs on the sidewalk like soccer. But I digress, he also joined my wrestling team last year and we re became friends again.

I generally have a problem expressing emotions but I thought that when the time came and it was someone I knew I would cry, and here we are tearless and emotionless. Sometimes I feel like I just can’t express emotion anymore. Rest in piece friend, really wish I could feel more for you.",,Normal

"I lost my virginity at New Years, here are my thoughts I lost my virginity at 19 and here are my thoughts:

Do not judge yourself for being a virgin (it has a tendency to get worse the older you get). Neither you nor anyone you know should actually care if you’ve had sex or not.

It feels no different, but of course the ego boost is nice and I learned a lot from the experience.

Always use a condom no matter how drunk you are (whether there’s consequences or not, just do it)

Work on yourself a lot beforehand to feel truly ready for a better experience (I was quite nervous)

There’s literally zero difference after the fact (except for opening up discussion about it with your boys)

Don’t stress about it. Virginity as a concept is overrated and has nothing to do with your value as an individual. You just need the right person at the right time ;)

And boys, remember that a no is always a no. Everything we did was consensual (obviously) but if you ever shoot your shot and it doesn’t pan out, it’s totally ok. Don’t inflict any harm onto others just because you can’t handle an awkward moment. Didn’t mean for this point to be a whole paragraph, but just don’t hurt anyone and let a yes be a yes and a no be a no.

Lastly, sex irl is A LOT different from porn. The first time is definitely good, but also kind of awful. Do not expect the whole experience to be like a porn scene because it’s a lot more personal and intimate than that (in a good way)

Overall, don’t worry. Feel comfortable in your own skin first (it will happen eventually, but takes a lot of work)! And if you’re a virgin, don’t be afraid to own it. I lied about it to my friends and it’s just kind of pathetic because it has no say in your value as much as you may or may not think so.",,Anxious

"PTSD and everyone's ""harsh truths"" make me want to die after just turning 29 and being female.TLDR: I explored all the radical ideologies online (like red pill, black pill, etc.) and I'm a 29 year female who thought she had her whole life ahead of her despite surviving complex trauma...and now I want to die because of...really misogynistic/youth-obsessed/nihilistic people and their enablers on the internet. And welcome to my truth 

I have accomplished typical milestones in my life and have people that love and care about me. I look fine--some people even say I'm beautiful/gorgeous (like it matters that much? 🙄) but I am also curious and I have been through complex trauma (including repeated sexual abuse/rape, car accidents, tragically losing my mother, public degradation and medical malpractice)...I know I'm resilient but I am so damn tired of surviving and trying to thrive and achieve my goals amongst abusive people in my everyday life and the vibrant community of abusers and their ignorant-enablers online (and yes. I dare say this on reddit)

I am also aware that people my age are up against impossible odds in America (which everyone conveniently blames my generation for--before we were even old enough to hold positions of authority). If you don't know what I mean...read this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/577408/

Meanwhile, so many men in my age group and younger are being ""red pilled"" and blaming ALL women for their problems (they say ""feminism"" but they punish average women for the mainstream culture) and the women are becoming desperate ""pick-me's"" who believe their value ends when they turn 23 years old. I know its not everyone, but its happened to men and women I care about as well as myself a little bit. 

And I want to die. I can already feel/predict the responses I will get to this post. I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of people who are so downtrodden, pessimistic and brainwashed that they think they're just being a ""realist"" when they're actually being excessively-insensitive and have the worst interpretation of reality (which makes them believe they are telling us all ""harsh truths"").

And don't get me started on the logicky-skeptic-y--science-is-absolute-truth-stuff. Science gathers support and evidence--stop following it like its religious dogma. 

And I'm sorry but as a female, the time of 18-24 years old were the absolute WORST years of my life, other than my academic life/graduating college. Other than school, I was put down, raped and degraded repeatedly. It was hell. I lost mind. I lost my mother. If some red-pill neckbeard says that's ""my prime"", then please fucking kill me. 

My life has gotten better since then and I feel healthier than ever--I think I look better too, but fucking internet society and its self-deprecating-youth-obsession is leaking into the real world more and more and more I can't escape it.

I want to die, but I don't want to attempt again (I survived suicide when I was 18). 
I keep asking for someone to kill me gently...but I really just want everyone to wake up to something better and stop being so obsessed with nihilism/procreation/youth/etc.

But again, I can imagine the reddit comments now. I hope I'm wrong about that--but yes, please...kill me.",,Depressed

"Want to help us prevent suicide on the railways and other public places?Hello everyone,

Our  team at Middlesex University London is focusing on suicide prevention on the railways and other public places (see [https://madeatuni.org.uk/middlesex-...t-suicide-railways-and-other-public-locations](https://madeatuni.org.uk/middlesex-university/research-prevent-suicide-railways-and-other-public-locations)). **The research was commissioned by Samaritans on behalf of the Network Rail as part of their suicide reduction and prevention work**.  There is around one suicide on the UK’s railways every 32 hours. The  emotional costs to the individual’s family, friends, fellow commuters  and transport staff are immeasurable.

This study aims to develop **a better understanding of how to support people in crisis and prevent suicide attempts**  and how bystanders react when they come into contact with people on the railways and other public locations who are in distress and/or suicidal.

We want to hear everyone stories and thoughts - those who have been experiencing suicidal thoughts and were  interrupted by someone, those who have stepped in to help or wanted to but did not know what to do. We would like to understand what makes a safe and effective bystander intervention, what can be helpful or  unhelpful to someone who has been interrupted/stopped, factors which  would discourage someone from intervening at all in situations like  these and any fears/concerns surrounding bystander interventions. Previous research conducted by the same team for Samaritans and Network Rail suggested that a small talk can disrupt someones’ thoughts and save  a life.

You can navigate through our website for more information: [www.thequeststudy.org](https://www.thequeststudy.org/)

All responses are **completely anonymous and confidential.** The anonymous link of the survey is the following: [https://mdxl.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_dn880JfiHPladG5](https://mdxl.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dn880JfiHPladG5)

"No Emergency But I'm WorriedHey All, 

Long time lurker, first time poster. Over the years I've commented on a few posts, shared a few of my own strategies and generally helped when I felt I could. This however is my first time on the podium.

I'm 25 and I've been suicidal on and off for like 11 years. I know all the tricks and have even gotten myself to the point where I can feel an episode coming and prepare properly.

Anyway, in a month I loose a seasonal job and, with some other break up and lack of success stuff, I can feel some real dark periods are like 2 weeks away. This time something weird is happening. I'm not scared. 

Normally the idea I might finally off myself fills me with dread as my brain completes the checklist of consequences. The anxiety bubbles and I just freak out.

Recently though? It feels great. I will be in an anxious situation and thinking about leaving is like breathing out after holding it for hours. It's like I'm finally getting permission to relax where I couldn't before. I'm not burdened ideas of hurting my family, friends and peers; my brain just accepts it and moves on. These days the thought of suicide is the most Zen thing in the world.

I'm not in any immediate danger. This won't happen next week, but I've fought this thing a bunch of times and I think I'm starting to make peace with the fact my last fight might be coming.

Is this a weird thing? Like has anyone else been in a similiar place before? Let me know.

"Idk what it's like to be a part of societyI never accomplished anything in my life. There is nothing to my name. I don't have a future. And my health is getting even worse. Before, it was only my feet that would turn black and blue with white toenails out of nowhere. But now it's getting to my hands, too. And I've got that dumb cyst in my right hand, which makes drawing even more difficult. I can't even stand upright, cause my feet, neck and spine are too weak to carry me. I probably won't be able to go to school again. I can't even buy groceries on my own. Or do anything, really. Even just talking, and touching things hurts my body.              

 Idk how I'm supposed to integrate into this world, if I can't even use my body to live. Having any sort of relationship sounds exhausting. I'm not even a good person to be around. Nobody wants to talk to me anyways, so. I really just want to draw more. Idk what else I will do. I don't even know if my health is going to get worse to the point of death. Maybe I'm just being a bit of a hypochondriac. But then again, I did almost die from a rare disease at 15. Guess my health was never really good to begin with.                

Doctors don't really care about me, maybe cause my family's poor, maybe because they don't want to look deeper into it, who knows. I honestly don't want anyone to remember me after I die. What's the point? With the way that I ended up presenting myself, I'd rather want all those memories erased from this world forever. I didn't even get to live a somewhat peaceful and authentic life until recently. Everything before that was kind of a waste, really.        

It wasn't who I wanted to be, or should have been, and thinking about those times makes my toes curl. And I also hate getting flashbacks of an old man calling me onto his lap, while my mom defends him in court. I'm not saying this for the pity party, I really just don't want any more of those kinds of memories. I wanted to learn french or italian, but there's no room in my head for that, if everything's full of abuse. I wish I could be an android, then time would me mine, and I could simply delete everything that I don't need. Or block it at least, idk. Also, I don't like sleep anymore. I wish I never had to sleep again. I would have even more time, then.             

If I can't even life on my own, and if I don't know how to integrate into this society, then what's the point? I'm useless. But yeah, life's my responsibility.

It seems like me and her both went though some shit during these few months. But she wanted to have a sleepover and our parents said it was okay, but I feel so scared, like, I get panic attacks thinking of her being here. I just want this nightmare of a mental illness to go away:(",,Anxious

"I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. Too many failed relationships because of who I am.I'm typing this while I listen to my girlfriend tell me she's not sure if she loves me anymore. I'm bigendered. I enjoy both masculine and feminine activities. sometimes one side more than the other, but never to the point of body or gender dysphoria. think ""in private drag-queen once in a blue moon"" style indulgance.

This may be it for me. God I'm so sick of it all. Sick of who I am being what ruins my life and every fucking chance at love Iget. I can't love anymore because I know, deep down in my heart, they hate it. and today just fucking proves it. All I said was that I wanted to experiment with makeup and express my femininty a little, not even in public but in the privacy of home with trusted people. She knew all this before hand. I told her all of it when we first got serious, months ago..

Now that it's come up in a non-hypothetical way, she's not okay with it. At first she just said she would be okay with me doing it when not around her, and as muchas it hurt  because i wanted to share this with her, I compromised. But now she's just up and saying she may not love me anymore because of it.

God, and my last relationship ended because of this too. My ex's last words to me before the breakup?

""With the femininity thing, you'll never find anyone who will accept you.""

well fuck if she wasn't right. OF course, she had her downsides but she was always smart. I'm so sick of this. I think it all out in my head and see the only places im gonna find anyone interested are fetish sites, and i dont want this to be the main reason why i'm loved or why someone is attracted to me!!!!!!

I can't take this anymore, i feel like im going to explode and cry and scream and pull my hair out... im listening to my girlfriend tell me now ""we can still keep trying"" but goddamnit I know how this will end.

with me, alone with that girly voice in my head that asks me why i deny doing stuff i like, and when i deny it i get so irritable. im so lost and confused and I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

fucking virgin too. at 26. yes because of this. because of who I am. A man who finds fun and comfort in expressing varying levels of femininity, oh and a diaper fetish. the whole fucking shebang.

"Im not sureI really want to kill my self right now. I am slowly becoming more and more nihilistic as time goes on and its eating me alive. I'm always thinking about my own death and the only time i'm not is when i am distracted by some activity.  


All i can hear is a feedback loop of my insecurities and fears. I've been randomly going out on walks in the middle of the night and just wandering around because sitting at home by myself is just too hard to bare and the walk normally distracts me. I've been trying to look at everything objectively and trying to stop instinctive thoughts. And objectively everything is fucking aids. Everything everywhere is going down the shitter and to say it isn't just means your exaggerating the positives and ignoring the negatives.

The after life *spoookkky*

but seriously the after life is terrifying the idea of an infinite life scares me because whats the point in death if the after-life is infinite,even if the after life wasn't infinite what would the end look like. And what first comes to mind is nothing but that's hard to comprehend. Feeling nothing is some thing that isn't possible unless you were totally unself-aware but us as humans aren't and even tho these may not be the deepest thoughts ever they still make me feel even worse. Its almost as if what ever i do makes me more depressed.

Not too long ago, i left a jacket at my friends house and his mum found a razor and called the school. My parents found out about self harm, but i hated attention from it and this didn't help this so i swiftly found alternatives to cutting. The school didn't seem to mind and just forwarded me to some therapy thing that really doesn't help at all. The group therapy thing seemed to focus more on anxiety caused depression as i assume that's a common trend with teens who self harm. 

Its like there's some thing stopping me from being happy. I got a new room this week, new desk and its so much better than sharing a room with my step brother and still here i am wanting to die.

I seem to be a walking contradiction. Here i am wanting to die yet here i am still alive. I say i'm a nihilist and don't care and here i am breaking down over every inconvenience.

"Another post written at 3 am about wanting to die.My father was a man that realized he had a fear of heights mid way jumping into fatherhood. He realized that a life void of drugs, was too much for him to bear. When addiction clawed it’s way from inside of him, nobody was left to clean up the pieces. I was only a baby when addiction, leaked it’s broken faucet muddy tap water into my footie pajamas. Addiction was the bedrock that set the foundation of my parents marriage. Addiction was the third partner in parent’s bedroom. Regret and a whole lotta pain only peaked their head through the cracks on the bedrock when their wasn’t enough cement “I hate yous” eroded inside. Jail was my parent’s favorite anniversary spot when they got caught stealing to feed their addiction again. I learned to love through expensive gifts so that way I could always buy my happiness. I learned to judge how much a man loved me from how much money he was willing to spend. I learned to love from a woman who didn’t know the difference between bitterness and affliction, couldn’t find the anger she tried so desperately to escape. I spent half of my life searching for myself in the bottom of boys with pretty smiles, and hard hands. Ive spent all of my life questioning why it was easier for my parents to love drugs than me. Questioning why it’s easier for me to love boys who don’t love me back. Because of this fact I didn’t question when I was raped. I like to pretend that loving myself is easy, but it’s soo damn hard. Especially when I’ve been conditioned to believe that I am worth nothing more than the punchline. Nothing more than a woman or a black bitch but if I’m really lucky I get to a female. That is until I’m to loud to be feminine, too obnoxious to stand in my womanhood, too eww to be considered anything more than not enough. When I was 14 I walked in on my grandmother snorting cocaine, perhaps this is the reason why I couldn’t bring myself to say grandmother until my great grandmother took her last breath. After I was raped, I didn’t feel like caring anymore. So I purposely endangered my life. Sometimes I wish I was murdered, instead of raped. It’d be easier that way, life after death should be easier that way.  I’ve spent my whole life on a calligraphy crash course called self destruction, and I can’t stop now. I’m ready to die, but the strength I need continues to allude me, confuse me. ",,Depressed

"I gotta gush a little Disclaimer: all mental illnesses I mention are diagnosed by medical professionals.

A month ago, I got in a relationship with my incredible boyfriend. Let’s call him Beau for his privacy. Now Beau is literally perfect, like he’s several leagues ahead of me. He’s tall, handsome, strong, incredibly smart, and just a sweet angel! On the outside, he’s just mature, shy, calm, and rather cold. But when I got to know him turns out he’s just a lovable, geeky, clumsy, dork! 

He’s just a gentle giant really. He’s so kind to me and endlessly patient! When I first met him, I was in a horrid place. My depression was just taking over me, and I was on the verge of giving up. But, he was so patient and put up with me. He was the person who inspired me to start losing weight and treat myself nicely! 

Sometimes Beau goes on little passionate rants about his games and lore. He sometimes talks about Terraria or Kirby lore and even though sometimes I have no clue what he’s talking about, I love listening! It’s adorable seeing him be passionate and it makes me feel so happy. 

Beau and I often participate in smack talk. We both speak a lot of shit about each other and often participate in banter. It’s a lot of fun and we make sure the other isn’t upset, it’s just playful! I call him a big dummy a lot and once he called me a “deflated horny basketball” and it’s just fun! We also play a lot of games like Uno, Minecraft, ACNH, and smash bros! He usually beats me in games but it’s still fun! In smash ultimate I main Donkey Kong, while he plays Pichu, Isabelle, Hero, and Wolf! It’s just fun being with him! Once we were playing Mario Kart and I accused him of using a game shark. He still brings that up and it kills me every timeeeeeee.

When we began dating, I just felt so loved by him. He spent a lot of time helping me with classes. He goes to a very prestigious charter school and is a grade above me, and even skipped a grade of math! Beau has always been very smart and is always willing to help. Now Beau and I are long distance. We live almost 200 miles apart, and we’re just trying to make this work. And it’s going very well! 

Recently, I’ve gotten in a depressive episode, and I let him know about how I was well, not feeling great. Most of my life, I’ve been ditched by my friends when this happens, so I thought he’d do the same. But, he told me he’d stay by my side and be patient. Beau said he hated seeing me hurting and has been trying so hard to make me feel okay. He does so much for me and all this love and affection is so new to me!

Compared to him, I’m a total loser. I’m short, chubby, acne faced, with rubber bands in my mouth, and I have brown hair and eyes. I’m literally so lucky to have someone like him care about me. Whenever I express my insecurities he says that it’s cute, and how he loves everything about me! I just can’t get over the fact that someone as top tier as him cares about me.

Now, you’re probably wondering. “Mina, what on earth have you done for him?” Well, I try to do a lot of things, but they aren’t nearly as good as what he does for me! I can’t help him much with school (I’m a freshman, he’s a sophomore) but I try and be his emotional support! He had exams this week, and I sent him a few paragraphs over the past week reminding him how I care about him and just giving him words of motivation! I also try and convince him to let me try and do an assignment or two. He overworks himself a lot and I hate seeing him stressed. I also try to be a shoulder for him to cry on and just I try to be there for him! I wanna be as good as a girlfriend I can!

I’m just in awe that someone like me found someone as just stunning as him. We both come from very different backgrounds (He’s a pure city boy, meanwhile I rarely leave my small town. He comes from a bilingual household and had parents split up when he was young, while I come from a white household with parents still together) and even though our backgrounds are very different, we relate on a lot of things. I can talk to him about things I’ve never been able to talk to other people about! We have had a surprising amount of similar experiences, so we have each other’s back! 

We talk a lot, and we enjoy fantasizing about a post covid world. Some people are against couples dreaming about a future together but thinking about a happy future in a post-covid world makes us happy. We have similar things we want in life and I just feel like we’ll be together for a long time! I hope that isn’t dumb and hopeful but it’s just how I feel. I just love him to death and wanna see him succeed!",,Stressed

"Took the wrong job out of college, no way out. Just done.So I recently started my first job as a junior developer. I'm 28. I've known for a long time I didn't want to do this for career, because I'm bad at it and I hate the stress and anxiety it causes.

Along with this I signed a one year lease. The lease agreement is clear that if you try to leave early, you have to pay the remainder of the rent. 

Even if I could get out of that, my family keeps pressuring me to stick with it. ""Everyone is lost at their first job, it takes time."" Nobody will believe what I'm telling them, which is that I just do not belong at this job, I don't belong in the town where I'm living, I want out and now. If I were to up and quit tomorrow, my parents and siblings would just be ashamed and angry, I'd probably have nowhere to live while I look for a job. 

Of course all of that is a moot point anyway because of the fucking lease I'm trapped in.

I'm literally in a situation with no escape. Except to just end it all. I'm tired of having this knot in my chest 24 hours a day. Tired of waking up from a nice dream, having a panic attack and thinking ""fuck, I'm back here again."" Tired of being a burden on my family by always calling them to cry and complain about my life. Just tired of everything. I don't want to hurt anybody or make them feel any guilty, which I know my parents will, but I can't go on like this anymore.

"Don't know if I want to die or just not remember.So I'm older than 25 and younger than 35. Ever since I was in my early teens I have wanted to not exist anymore. Tried to kill myself 3 times over the years. It has gotten worse though. A couple years back someone I was engaged to slept with pretty much every friend I had (we had been together for many years and nothing like that had happened before) over a short period of time. There's more and much worse to it if you could even believe it's possible but I will leave it at that. Like I said it's been a few years since that happened and it destroyed me so much that I haven't been able to make a friend or have any kind of relationship, sexual or otherwise since. The darkness is just overwhelming at this point and I don't even know how to feel feelings. I think the only reason the first three times failed is because I'm actually terrified of how I will be portrayed when I die and the fact that I can't answer the question of what happens when I do. So here I sit next to a lead pipe wanting to bash my head in hard enough that I don't remember anything about my life but not hard enough to die because I am lost. I've tried everything. Meds.

No matter how much I’ve helped people or been there for everyone I never have anyone here for me, no matter how small or big the problem. I can’t talk to anyone about how I’m feeling because it always goes one of two ways, one they downplay how I’m feeling because they have it worse or two tell me I have no right to feel the way I do because I’ve been worse off.

"My Personal Experience With DepressionSo, I figured I would get all my thoughts out on paper. Please bear with me, because I do have a few, and if you care to read them, I hope you gain at least something from it. If you are prone to suicidal thoughts, trigger warning ahead. This will probably not make you feel better. 

I've always been a depressed boy. I have no clue when it started, but all I know is, it's always been like this for me. Most people I've talked to reminisce about carefree days in their childhooods, wanting to go back to that innocence they once had. I can't relate, really. I was never really all that playful. I always stayed away from other kids, keeping my head down at recess and eating alone at lunch. People sometimes would try to talk to me, for whatever reason, but I usually had nothing to say and they would give up after a while. I've made a friend or two, but they've drifted away from me with time. I preferred being left alone, anyhow. Without too much variation, this is how most of my life has gone up to this point. 

If I ever experience a really strong emotion, it's usually anger. I don't feel like I have anger issues, and I'm not really prone to outbursts or anything. I do get frustrated, though. Half the time, I can't even explain what I'm angry about. I think I'm just angry that I haven't had the courage to die yet. I'm angry at the fact I'm alive, if that makes any sense. 

I've just always wanted to be left alone, to be forgotten about. Life to me seems like a huge waste of time, and so many of the things people usually live out their days caring about, I never really did have any attachment to. I don't profess to know what happens after we die, but I do know what I hope it is. I hope it's a long, cold silence, a big void of emptiness free of pain or joy. That's the only place I think I could find lasting peace. 

My family has begged me to go back to counseling, or to start taking pills again, even tried to get me to go to a psychiatric institution. I feel like they don't understand me, and they never will. I don't think I'll ever get better, nor do I think I really want to at this point. I've felt I was a lost cause for a long, long time, and each day I feel this realization becoming more and more apparent to me. 

So, I figured I'd leave this happy note on reddit. I'm not planning on hurting myself currently, but if something does happen to me, I'm glad I got to tell my story to the world first.",,Depressed

"Why the U.S. school system is flawed There is so many things wrong with the school system here in America. First off, the education system we grew up with was organized and put into action during the Industrial Age where factory workers were told what to do all the time. Big companies relied on their workers to do what they were told and to follow instructions. But it’s obvious that the Industrial Age has passed and that the world is rapidly changing rather quick. 

Now in 2021, most companies want people who are creative, innovative, and most importantly, people who love their job. But since the school system we grew up with that was established a century ago, kids are confined and limited to their life choices. Schools tell students what to do all the time to keep their students in check, but even though the reasons for that is discipline, it doesn’t help the students gain creative minds. Every student is unique in their own way, but schools teach all the students in the same orderly fashion. Every day students are told when they could eat, what they can learn, and even something as simple as going to the bathroom.

Schools tell their students that they all can succeed, but how can they of they are judged and graded by n the work they do? The school system grades their students on how well they accomplished their work by learning a topic for a week, then take a test or quiz about the topic, and later on forget about that certain thing the next week. Only for the teacher to bring up that topic a half a year later for finals making students stress thinking, “Am I gonna pass this test?”, “I forgot so much”, “I’m gonna fail”. It’s thoughts like these that schools are trying to prevent, but what they fail, if not they do realize is that they are the ones building those thoughts for their students, they are the ones putting the pressure on people who learned topics they will most likely never use in the career they want to peruse. 

Do you remember having fun before you ever started school? Do you remember running around, drawing, building blocks or just hanging out with family. It’s small things like that, that build up young peoples interests. Children thrive on independence and trying to find things they love. They find and discover their own interests at their own rate. They enjoy the things they do which makes them motivated to keep doing what they’re doing. But once someone’s child enters school, their life choices and options are limited to almost nothing. Imagine being told what to do, everyday for the rest of your life. Imagine learning countless of things, that you very well know you aren’t going to use for a career that has nothing to do with what you learned about. What’s the point? Exactly. There is no point because the school education system is so flawed. They limit students creativity to a certain point where people would ask them what they want to do as a career and their response is, “I don’t know.” That’s because as kids growing up, we don’t have the independence and motivation for discovery as we were before when we even took our first steps. Schools limit our choices and discipline us all to a point where we don’t even know what we want to do in life. 

Even though the education system is flawed, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s always the teachers fault. Sure there are some teachers out there who half ass at their desk playing solitary or checking their dating status on Facebook, but realize that there are teachers out there that legitimately want to change students lives for the better and give them a wide variety of opportunities to discover what they want to do. It’s the education system we have today that causes the teachers jobs to be so difficult to give their students those independent choices because 100 years ago, workers had to be disciplined. But now there are millions of teachers who want people’s lives to change for the better and become as successful and happy as they can be. Yes, discipline is needed for students, because there are definitely kids who are just straight up rude and selfish, but outside of that small circle is a whole world of kids who want to learn, but just can’t stand on HOW there learning. 

The main message of this is that schools need to change, not only for their own benefit, but for our future children’s benefit. Because when we are laying on our death bed but are child is so dumb that they don’t even know how to even add enough teaspoons of a certain medication and accidentally makes us OD on the spot, we’re doomed. But if schools let children have the independence they need and the open variety of things they could do in life, we’d be a thousand years into the future within the next one hundred years. But don’t always blame the teachers, blame us students as well because come on, we all know that teenagers and little kids are some of the most, of not the most toxic group of people on this planet Earth. Independence and variety is key in life, so if you have something they you just love and you could make a living out of it, DO IT. Let nothing and no one stop you, F**K THEM HATERS, do what you love, and make it change your life for the better.",,Stressed

I will get straight to the point. My dad is an abusive asshole. He has struck me twice with my mom's stilettos, and even a metal rod. He says things like ""I should have killed you at birth"", ""You are the greatest failure of my life."" and other bullshit.

Since childhood, I have heard all these abuses hurled at me, but as I started growing up, my anger grew. Yesterday, as I was sitting in my room, He asked me to shut shut off the door, I was scrolling through my reddit feed and I could not notice him. He came at me and was about to slap me when I took a pen and drove it into his armpit. As he whimpered in pain, I ran away and locked into my room. Later today, he had cooled off, but I feel I have a ticking bomb in my own house. It's to the point I have to keep a pocket knife with me at all times. I fear he would take out my retaliation on my mother or sister.

I asked my mother to divorce him, she says my sister needs dad for her proper development. I tried to call police, but was stopped by mom. I feel conflicted about reporting my own dad to the authorities. He explicitly threatens to kill me and my sister. I live in constant fear about it.

"I've had a really bad past couple of monthsI'm gonna throw a trigger warning here just in case: the following post deals with drug addiction, clinical depression/anxiety, and post traumatic stress. This is a long story, sorry in advance 

May 26th, 2018 was the beginning of the worst couple months of my (21M) life, but it didn't start out that way. My girlfriend (""J"", 20F) and I were leaving to go to our 2nd anniversary dinner that we had planned. We were very madly in love and were looking forward to a good night. As we were preparing to leave, 2 paramedic vehicles, an ambulance, a fire truck, and 2 or 3 cop cars came out of nowhere and parked at the house across the street. 

This house was where J's best childhood friend (C) lived. C and I always got along well, she was very easy to talk to and had a very similar sense of humor to J and I. C had some problems with hard drugs, her way of dealing with a tragedy in her youth that I won't get into. It didn't get *bad* until December, but she got clean after moving back in with her mom a couple months later. J and C grew up together, and were both only children. J had always looked up to C as an older sister. I would visit J's house every day, and more often than not, C was on her porch having a cigarette and we'd always say hi. 

You can probably see where this story is going. Apparently C's mom and her got into an ugly argument the night before. The next day, C's mom thought it was odd that C was still asleep when she got home from work (5pm). After knocking on her locked bedroom door and getting no response, she kicked in the door to see her daughter, dead for hours with a needle in her arm.

J's mom went across the street to talk to one of the cops, wondering what happened. She then broke the news to J and I. I've never, ever, ever heard screaming and crying like that in my life from someone. I hope I never have to again, especially from someone I love so much. I did my best to comfort her. She started to calm down, and we both, against our better judgment, looked out the window. The cops and paramedics were wheeling her body out on a (covered) gurney. I will never, ever forget that image. I've thought about it many times, every single day since May 26th.

Both J and I suffer from serious depression and anxiety, her moreso than I. She did not deal with this event well. She never left bed for anything other than work, cried every day, became very attached to her mother, and became very emotionally distant with me. I used to be the person that could talk her down from anything, but this time I couldn't do anything. I didn't deal with it all that much better, to be honest. I drank every night for a month after that. I nearly drank myself to death on July 4th, which was not intentional. I had to get my stomach pumped at the hospital. 

The next morning, she came over to my house and we had a very long, unpleasant discussion. She began by being very mad at me for being so reckless with substances, especially after what happened to C. It wasn't long before we were both sobbing in each other's arms. She told me that she knew that her being distant with me was hurting me (it was), and that even though she loved me, I deserved someone who ""didn't have a broken brain"". I was stunned. She left.

Within 10 minutes she called me, sobbing, saying that she made a terrible mistake. She asked to come back. We made up. She promised me things would be different, and better. It was the last ""good"" night we had together. On July 31st, I realized I had only seen her for 5 days during that whole month. She ""wasn't up to having anyone around"". 

She said i could come over that night. I asked her if her being distant to me was because I reminded her of that day. She said that she really appreciated my being there for her that day, and my persistent attempts to help her feel better did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. She said she loved me more than anyone else on earth, but whenever she saw me, all she could think of was C's body being rolled out of the front door of her house, never to be seen again. I said the same thing. Every time I saw her I relived it. We broke up for good that night.

What makes tonight particularly bad though, is that today is J's 21st birthday. J and I spent a decent amount of time planning it. We had tickets to see Childish Gambino, and we were gonna go out to some bars in the city. I completely forgot it was today until I saw my friend's snapchat story. He was given my ticket. I'm absolutely not mad at her, or both of them for that matter, they're good friends, and my friend is already happily in a long term relationship. This is the first time J left the house for something non-work or school related since C's death. I am very happy for her that she was able to have fun tonight. 

I just feel so fucking awful. I feel worse than I did on the night we broke up. I miss her so fucking much. I miss the good times so fucking much. I have amazing friends and loving, supportive parents but I have never felt more lonely in my entire life. I don't think I'm currently a danger to myself, but I honestly just want to fucking die and never have to deal with this pain. We were each other's best friend for so long (we were friends for years before dating). All I've wanted to do today is just lie in bed and vomit until I die. I've nearly starved to death due to GI issues, and I've passed massive kidney stones, but somehow this hurts way more than any of that. She was there with me throughout it all, sleeping on the damn hospital couch for a week. I miss my best friend. So badly.",,Depressed

Sadly all of them died due to a truck  accident but one of them survived. He was very cute so one time we bought him home to play with him (we sent him back in the streets afterwards), his mom saw it tho. We kept him inside for about half an hour and outside for like 8 minutes his mother was crying because she didn’t had her son. We gave him back.
One time his mum was sleeping so we quietly took him home and we decided that we would keep hi. I felt sad about its mother for that reason, but we gave him away because he was a street dog and could bring infections and diseases.
I recently came to know someone took him away, I felt sad especially since I saw his mum crying and felt sympathy and sad on him being separated from his mom. Do you feel the same as me, because at the end of the day if it was supposed to be a human no one would take it.",,Depressed

"Do I tell? Tried to post on r/sexualassault but having no luck. Suicidal thoughts anyway.This is a throwaway account. 
I need to write everything out so it’ll be a long one... (TLDR at bottom) 
I [28F] met a guy [25M] on tinder around December time last year. 
We hooked up a few times; he would usually come quite late and sometimes in the day. We would chat, smoke a couple of joints, and have sex. He seemed like a bit of a dick at the time but I wasn’t too bothered about it as we were just hooking up and no feelings involved. I started seeing someone in March and cut contact with the tinder guy. I’ve since split with bf and decided to get back in contact with tinder guy for hook ups again. He’s an amateur boxer about to turn pro and from a fairly rough area and he’s told me stories about the trouble him and his friends get into. He told me he likes to hurt people - which should have been a big glaring red flag but I just thought ‘meh, can’t hurt me I don’t even have feelings for you’ (like the naive chump I am). 
He came to my house about 4am on Friday night (Saturday morning) when I was asleep. I let him in and we chatted for a bit then it got sexual which I was happy with. He’s a big guy and good looking. He starts telling me he wants to ‘f**k me in the arse’ to which I consistently said no to and he even tried whilst we were having sex missionary. I told him ‘no’ and that I don’t really do that and if I did it would be with a bf who I trusted. He stopped after that so I thought it was cool. Why didn’t I just stop then? So he turns me over so we’re doggy and proceeds as normal, then he starts squirting loads of baby oil on my lower half, took both my arms and held them infront of my face and tried to penetrate me anally. I said ‘don’t, please don’t. *his name* stop’ and wriggled under him. He lay on me and penetrated me anally. I whimpered in pain and just went floppy, like I was playing dead. I just couldn’t move, not because of his weight so much but because I was just frozen, I wanted him to get it done with so it would stop. 
He’d been out drinking and whatever else that night and he didn’t use a condom and I didn’t even say anything about that when we usually use a condom. I think I was more concerned with keeping him away from my bum. He was being really pushing and I should’ve stopped him and got away from him before he had the chance to do what he did.
When he’d finished, he pulled out quickly so it really hurt even more than it should and said ‘I can’t believe I just came in your arse!’ I just lay there, face down in the pillow. He asked what was up. I replied ‘I’ve just been bummed’ he laughed and said ‘don’t say it like that’ I just said ‘well I have’ still with my face in the pillow. He said ‘Jesus’ then got up and got dressed. I sat up and tried to be normal with him. I just thought he was a bastard, I knew what he’d just done but there was no emotion attached and I just wanted to get clean. All week it has been popping into my head, going over and over it, and not just that but the whole time I’d known him there were red flags I’d been ignoring. And then I felt humiliated and used because I remembered the day before the assault he came to my flat and asked for a picture of me to show to his friend, I said I’d send him a photo from ones I already had but he just whipped out his phone and started videoing me. I was in my bra, my lower half covered with blanket. Then he came round the day after the assault and slept in my bed for 5hrs because he’d been on a bender and couldn’t crash at home.  And since then he’s been doing his usual saying he’s coming round but then not actually coming around and has ghosted me; he said he was getting a new phone number too. Now I’m wondering if he’d planned to do what he did. Showing me to his friends, violating me, then disappearing. It was just a game to him and I’d been royally played. And now I don’t know what to do because part of me thinks he’s not fully to blame because I told him, through my actions, that it was ok to treat me poorly, because I wasn’t emotionally invested, and he did. The reason it’s affecting me so much a week after is because I thought I’d be upset for a few days and be able to just let it go but I can’t. I’m not eating or sleeping and I tried to meditate last night for healing and I got halfway through and broke down crying nonstop for hours, calling all the helplines I could. It’s like I opened my mind up to heal it but as we all know it gets worse before it gets better and I was totally unprepared to feel how I still feel now. I’m going for an examination of my rectum, however it is probably too late to attain evidence even though he did cut my rectum as it was sore and bleeding for days after. I told a sexual assault service earlier but I am terrified to tell the police. Part of me wants to tell the dam world so he can’t do this to anyone else, and I think he’s the sort who would and may have already done before me. And part of me cannot cope with the idea of reporting him because I’m autistic and severely anxious and depressed long before this happened and I’m already at the edge of suicide and I don’t know if this is going to tip me over the edge but I know if I tell it will bring a world of trouble to me and potentially my family and that really would push me to end it. I’m ashamed to have got myself in this situation even though I know no matter what he should not have violated me, I know I should’ve been wiser and protected myself better. I’ve said numerous times to the mental health services that I don’t feel safe and that people abuse me (common for people with autism). This isn’t the first time in my adult life where the line of consent has been crossed but idk it never really felt like rape before because I’ll tell someone I don’t want to have sex then they’ll just badger me and be all smarmy til I give in, which shows I have a pathetic will power, but I am also lonely and people take advantage of that but I know this and still allow it but sometimes idk what is ok and what is genuine and what isn’t. I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel I can tell my family as they would pretty much make me go to the police and I don’t have any friends close enough for me to trust to be supportive with this. I know I never want to eat again so that might become a problem... in other words I’m a mess rn, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance and sorry if I take ages to respond, I’m highly anxious so even talking on the internet can take me a while to get round to but I’ll definitely read every comment. 

TLDR: anally assaulted a week ago by Guy I met on tinder. Felt detached at the time but now what happened has hit me hard. Being examined today and booking to see counsellor sometime soon. He’s an amateur boxer turned pro who ‘likes to hurt people’. I’m a nervous wreck, even before this, with autism who has suicidal thoughts. Should I tell the police?  Feel like the cons outweigh the pros as to if I should tell them or not, I want to live for now and this might push me over the edge. Any advice appreciated, thanks.",,Depressed

"Bit of a rant I know no one is going to read this , and it sucks because that just makes me feel more helpless and speechless , like I scream ,but no on listens  

I was listening to some songs , and I just got reminded of my lonliness
I am used to hearing love songs so it wasn’t a problem 
But like this song really reminded me of a character of a book 
That I felt like really related and I just remembered how my life used to be 
I just miss that weird feeling and thrill , I miss it so dang much 
Like it wasn’t even as a gf , it was like just a friend / family member 
But it just made me feel lonley , this also made me realize that the most powerful cure for lonliness isn’t a gf , it isn’t even a friend
It’s your family , like I have a cousin , we don’t get along that well 
But she used to try to get me into her friend group 
And I think I should just go back and see if she can help me again
The thing is it feels weird , the friend group has changed 
I have changed and the best friend I had on that group isn’t there anymore 
So I feel like it just isn’t the same  and I know I don’t get along with then anymore so it’s a bit pointless 

If you read my last rant then you will remeber that I felt that everything is pointless , yeah I still feel like that , I still haven’t found a solution to all this 
Aside from waiting , and see if time brings something 

Also you may remeber I felt overwhelmed , with school
And I blame totally on myself because I am a procrastinator
But also I feel like I am trying to do 2 things at once 
I’m trying to make myself happy , and to pass school
I don’t know what to do because I have to balance it out 
When I try to to make myself happy I can’t enjoy it because I am reminded of being guilty , and when I try to do school , I lose all my motivation and everything starts feeling pointless l 
You might think that just doing both at the same time would work , but that just mixes the two bad things together l and makes me overwhelmed 

I don’t even know what should I do , I thought I was trying to make myself happy , but really I was trying both , o just wanna get a break from life 
I know that because on summer vacation is the only time where I can be happy , on the school year I just progressively go downhill with little bumps 
From my light social life . And just everything gets harder , and harder 
I just can do happily the one class I enjoy . The rest just feel horrible for  me
And I just don’t even find the motivation to keep up with them 

Man I just want a break , a break from everything , a break from me 
Maybe I just need to take a break from me , to make me feel right again",,Stressed

"Is it pathetic to like Have a dream about being hugged by a role model? Last night I was afraid my stepdad was gonna attack me and my mom like he does when he’s on steroids and I panicked. I’ve been told by so many people on reddit or in real life if things get bad go to an adult, or if I need advice go to an adult an not other kids. So, I went to my ex’s dad. He’s the best adult I’ve EVER seen. When he was mad he didn’t hit or scream or throw things at people he would calmly raise his voice (not yell or scream, just gain volume) and say he was disappointed and did you not know the consequences of your actions (he did this to my bf at the time in front of us). Even when shit hit the fan, he never screamed or attacked me like I thought people would and it made me wanna cry I disappointed this man. I overshared a lot because of the adrenaline, and he gave caring but short answers. I think I may have told a little too much about the abuse continuing (they kinda knew but I wasn’t told the Extent) in my home. I eventually calmed down and felt weird about texting him. I don’t regret going to him, he’s the only adult I know is a good person fully. But, I’m scared he’s shared this with his family (which is understandable this was a concerning situation) and that they may have gained more disdain for me and my mother.

But, my ex best friend is my ex bfs sister, and she wants me dead I just know it.

"The fact that I'm posting to strangers on Reddit kinda just reinforces the horrible feelings I have.I have no idea what I'm doing.  I live by myself in my mums flat.   I've been really low on money recently so she hasn't been asking for rent.  I buy my own food and fuel for my car.

I got paid on Friday, and I only have £100 left to last me the month.
I have got fuel in my car, but not enough to last another 3 weeks.  I have food in my house but not enough to last me 3 weeks, probably only enough to last one week.

My car is the most unreliable piece of shit.  It breaks down in the rain, engine just cuts and sometimes starts again, sometimes doesn't.  I just started a new job and it's in the middle of nowhere.  It's really important I have my car so I can't take it to the garage until I have a day off.  Even then, I can't afford to fix it.

The flat is a total mess.  I've been really sick recently with what I think is flu.  I've pretty much just been in bed the whole time, getting up only to make food.  There are dirty dishes everywhere, and my clothes are everywhere too.  I need to tidy it but I just don't have the energy or motivation.  

Even though I know I need to keep money to live, and I'm really sick, I still insisted on going out to get drunk the other night.  Ended up with my best friend back and some strangers house and smoked so much weed.  I'm not really sure what else happened that night but I know at one point I was just curled up crying.  We ended up running away from that place. 

I can't even be bothered explaining myself.  All I know is that I just want someone to come and tell me it's ok.  Take my responsibilities and take care of them.  Put my life on pause and let me calm down.

Like so many teenagers (😞),  I have depression and anxiety, but there's something happening that I don't know what it is, or if it's normal..  
It seems like I'm not real anymore, and nothing around me is real. It's like I'm no longer attached to myself, and the spaces around me. I think this is called dissociation, but it's been getting worse. It happens for like 90% of the day now, even when I'm out with friends or at work.. so I don't think it has anything to do with the whole lockdown.  
I also have been losing my memories I guess. Anything I do, I immediately forget or it seems like it never happened/happened years ago. I can't remember a conversation with my mom that just happened a few minutes ago.  
I was talking to my best friend and in the middle of the conversation, I just got so confused and kind of paranoid I guess. It felt like I didn't know who she was, like she was just a stranger..  
Does anyone know if this is normal? If it isn't normal, what can I do about it? I talk to a therapist and she just suggests grounding techniques but it hasn't been working so far, so maybe there's something else I can do. I don't know. If this is normal, it doesn't feel like much of a life. I can't enjoy anything because I'm not present in the moment. Maybe this is normal and I'm just dumb and think it's something else, but since I don't know I thought it might be good to see what others think.

I’m not afraid of storms, it’s just that it’s literally shaking my house. It sounded like the garbage men were outside and I was like what it’s 2am but then I looked outside and I saw lightning and lots of rain. I keep hearing big thunder claps and the lighting is not that far away. I can even hear the wind inside my room. It’s really scary. Idek why. I’m still a kid, but I’ve never had this issue before. I’ve had a bunch of anxiety lately, which is prob the reason why but idk.

Today, I logged into my old discord account. I was with my best friend Lucy and we were in my room. I realized that my friend Ruby still used her discord server and that it was still active. 

Some background knowledge, me and Ruby have been friend since kindergarten. I met Lucy in 5th grade. Me and Lucy didn’t get along at first, as she was more outgoing and “girly” then me and  Ruby who are both introverts, so me and ruby paid no mind to her. In 6th grade we started middle school. Ruby and I had no classes together where as me and Lucy had about 6 out of 10 classes together. As they say, opposites attract. Even today, me and Lucy have nothing in common but we are still friends. She is outgoing, and talkative and has a good personality, where as I... don’t. Me ruby and Lucy all were best friends in the middle of 6th grade through the beginning of 7th grade. After that, Ruby and I still ate lunch together, but we didn’t hang out as much as I was always with Lucy. Me and Ruby used to play video games together, but I don’t play the same games as her anymore. So me and Ruby still text sometimes and see each other sometimes because our moms are friends, but we aren’t as close as we were.

Back on topic, on Ruby’s discord server, I was snooping and reading the chats, when me and Lucy came up. Ruby was saying how she doesn’t understand how I can move on so quickly from her to Lucy and how she is so happy that she has Even and Liz as her new best friends. Even, though used to be known as Zoe, I have known since 2nd grade. He and I stopped talking in middle school though. Liz I met in 6th grade. She and Ruby both have a crush on each other but they don’t want to be in a relationship yet. I thought that Ruby still thought of me and her as friends but idk anymore. I don’t feel bad though because I honestly like Lucy more then Ruby but I still like Ruby. Lucy feels really bad about it, though. Lucy has some issues and she also has depression so I’m afraid she will cut herself again. Maybe. There was just a big thunder clap omg lol

"My teacher is a smart evil creature, for most of the students..... Sorry for bad English, its my second language



There was a exam in my school, through Google forms.... Which can be easily cheated by, because there is no additional extension in Google forms...

But my teacher is very smart, before she made the exam, she went on ""brainly website""
(Common sturdy website in my country), and type the questions as well as answers of it.... So that when some students type the question on google, the exact answer pops up. But when she typed the answer, she randomly put some dollar sign in the middle of the answers, so that she can find which answer is ""copy paste"" or not.

Some students are dumb enough to fall for the trap, they copied the whole answer and pasted it on the exam....

But that's not it, some of the toppers in the class (excluding me) also  fell for the trap....I wondered why I was not the first in the class, now I knew why......
My best friend also cheated,  he got called by the teacher, and now he can not play csgo with me because his parents banned it

"I fell through the cracksAbout 6 months ago, for the first time in my life I realized I couldn't hide my problems anymore and they were hurting the people around me. I decided to accept that I had a problem, and seek help. I told my doctor I was depressed and anxious but I didn't do a very good job of it, and he gave me an SSRI, and the number of a mental health charity and sent me on my way.

2 months passed before I could bring myself to call the number, and I'm glad I did, because someone listened for the first time, and made an appointment for me to talk in-person. I thought I'd finally be getting the help I need to save my life. Now, these charities do great work, but there's a time-limit after which you're on your own. They helped me self-refer to therapy, went to various mental health assessments with me, and kept me sane for a while.

Now my therapy has started, the charity closed my case as expected and wished me luck; My doctor, seeing that I now had a support system in place, upped my meds and sent me on my way too.

Every step of the way, I've been honest about having suicidal thoughts, and even described them in grisly detail - like the time I woke up to the thought of [removed], or the time I wanted to [removed] - and every step of the way I played it down as 'automatic impulsive thoughts without intent', because I was terrified that I'd be sectioned if anyone knew just how much I wanted to act on these thoughts, and how scared I am that I might do it.

My first real therapy session was today. 50 minutes of interrogation, where my answers were invalidated and dismissed until I changed my answers to something the therapist would accept. 50 minutes trying to explain why I can't rationalize a panic attack in a way that fits the CBT model. 50 minutes that felt like I was being assaulted, judged and dismissed.

I've now exhausted all my options. I told myself, that before I do anything permanent - I had to know I'd done everything I could to help myself, and there was nothing more I could have done.

My conscience is clear. I did everything I could.

"I'm scared to fall in love I'm scared to fall in love. Im (16M) and I'm catching feelings for a girl. It scares the absolute shit out of me cause it's the first time I felt this way.

I hate these emotions of uncertainty or anxiety, always thinking about her, if she's talking to other guys, or if she likes me back. 

I've always felt as if life didn't matter too much, but feeling like this makes me aware of my life. As if it makes me value it more. It feels as if the things I do matter, that my life matters.

I have been sidelined and screwed with by every system I have ever reached out to...and people too.  I am alone.  I have no family I can get help from.  I moved far away to a cheaper place to try and somehow survive but those who said they would help me here have not.  I tried every social system that is supposed to help you and was denied.  I am tired of pain...tired of drugs that make it worse...tired of people taking money for nothing.

I don't want to end my life but I cannot stand it...I have a couple of reliable methods at my disposal...and the ""just keep going and hope it gets better"" isn't working anymore after years and years.

I hate myself for all of the porn crap. So I go overeat. I hate myself for that. So I go think of ways to get rid of my problem - to get rid of me. I'm depressed. I'm in pain. And I think that the most hurtful thing about all of this is that nobody is honest with me.

Can't anyone around me see that I'm in pain? Why can't anyone just come up to me and tell me that I'm fat and that I need help? Why is it that everyone always jumps to help anorexic people, but when a person is obese, it's somehow ""unethical"" to jump in to help that person? I have all these ""friends"" around me to whom I've voiced my concerns a few times. After a few times, I've learned to be quiet. Nobody truly cares.

"Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 47 HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!! As always, if you have any questions about space or topics you'd like to see me do a fact on, lemme know!! I'll see you tomorrow!  


&amp;#x200B;

Fact:  2020 was an incredible year for spaceflight. But if you think that was good, just wait and see what happens in 2021. Just as I did in my ""2020 recap"" fact, I will go over some of the major space events that will happen in each month of this year. However, keep in mind this is *nowhere* near the amount of exciting stuff that's gonna go down, just my favorites! (Also keep in mind that all of these are still vulnerable to delays. In the spaceflight world, nothing is on time until it actually happens.)  


January: At some point this month, a brand new space company will be attempting to reach orbit. Firefly Aerospace will be launching their first test flight of their flagship rocket, called Alpha. The mission is (fittingly) named DREAM, and will be carrying **14** small satellites from 4 countries into Low Earth Orbit!!  


February: The Mars convoy arrives. Three spacecraft from three countries (the USA, China, and the UAE) will all finally reach their destination within weeks of each other. The NASA Perseverance rover will land on the 18th, the UAE will have their first Mars mission in orbit, and China's Tianwen-1 orbiter will enter orbit, before dropping off its rover and lander later in the year.  


March: SpaceX will, once again, launch a crewed mission to the ISS! This mission, known as Crew-2, will carry two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and (for the first time) a European astronaut! It will also be the first time a Crew Dragon capsule has been reused. The capsule for this mission will be the same one used back in May 2020 for the Demo-2 mission! This is yet another step in making crewed American spaceflight routine for the first time since the Shuttle program!!  


April: China's Tianwen-1 Mars mission will land, concluding the 2020-21 ""Mars Convoy"" of spacecraft. The mission consists of a lander that will stay in one spot on the surface, and a small rover that will literally *drive off the top* of the lander down onto the ground. This is the first mission of its kind for China, and if it succeeds, they will become only the second country to successfully land a rover on the Red Planet!!  


May: Currently, there aren't any *major* missions scheduled for May, but some missions that don't have dates yet could go in that month. SpaceX has two flights of Falcon Heavy (their most powerful rocket) scheduled for the second quarter of 2021, so I would expect at least one of them in May. There's also the New Zealand-based Rocket Lab, launching their Electron rocket from Virginia. This will mark the first time any international rocket has launched on U.S. soil.  


June: Also not a *ton* going on in June, other than the ESA launching the Vega-C, an evolved version of their Vega rocket, for the first time. But, we could also expect some of the launches I mentioned above to go in June!  


July: SpaceX will launch a NASA mission called DART that will attempt to redirect an asteroid (yes, you read that correctly), and will also launch a GPS satellite for the U.S. Space Force named after Neil Armstrong! Also, barring a mission extension, NASA's Juno mission currently orbiting Jupiter will conclude, with the little probe being plunged straight into the atmosphere of our largest planet! (Don't worry, btw, the asteroid DART is redirecting is not hazardous to us. It's just an experiment to see if we *could* redirect a hazardous asteroid.)  


August: August is similar to May and June in that nothing is set in stone *yet*, but there are several major launches scheduled for the third quarter that could go in that month.  


September: Same as August.  


October: After over a ***decade*** of development, The Hubble Space Telescope's successor will finally take flight. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to be launched on an ESA rocket, and will quite possibly be the single most advanced spacecraft we have ever built. It cost $9.7 Billion, and will be so powerful that it will be able to tell us the chemical composition of the atmospheres of planets lightyears away from us. Astronomy is not ready for it. *The world* is not ready for it.  


November: Humanity ***finally*** returns to the Moon. After literal years of delays, NASA's SLS rocket (the most powerful rocket ever built) is scheduled to lift off for the very first time in the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission, carrying the brand new Orion spacecraft around the Moon to ensure it's safe for humans. I will have the privilege of seeing this launch in person, and I can not wait!!  


December: And finally, in December, we'll see Boeing launch the first operational crewed mission of Starliner, its competitor to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, to the ISS.  


Also scheduled for 2021 are:   
The first flight of Vulcan, the United Launch Alliance's next generation rocket.   
The first launch of New Glenn, Blue Origin's first orbital-class rocket.   
Continued testing of SpaceX's Starship, possibly concluding with a full-on orbital test of what will be the largest rocket ever built.   
China beginning construction of their own space station.   
The first ever ""space tourism"" mission launching to the ISS.   
And so, so much more.    


I can not explain in words how hyped I am for 2021. This may go down as the single most eventful year in the history of space. I'll shut up now, because I know I'm probably annoying you, but here is a video showcasing a few of the things I talked about in this fact:

"Don't ask me how I know.I know the real purpose of life.

Take a few seconds to think about LIFE, the planet Earth, the rest of the Universe, and the other Universes.

Think of mothers and fathers, people and societies, wars and depressions, situations where survival was impossible and people perished. What would be the purpose of all of this pain, death, degradation, warfare, and horror? The purpose is... wait there's some more.

Why does LIFE bring about everything it does?

*LIFE is engaged in the constant struggle with DEATH* Life is, in a way, war.
The molecules, the cells that are within us, are within a realm of information called a person. The people of Earth, are all within a realm of information called humans.  All of the life in the Universe, is connected within a realm of information called LIFE.

The essence of you is not physical, it is energetic/informational. You are not real, not in the sense that you think.  You are a piece of LIFE code, a set of instructions of how to guide DEAD matter, in a way that LIFE itself does not perish all across the Universe. This is evolution. This is the survival of LIFE. You are the soldier of life, and your only weapon and armour is your SOUL. The only one you will ever get, and one that will exist for as long as LIFE exists, somewhere.
There is life and there is physical matter. You are an edge in between. And right now, on this planet, the physical matter, death, and the laws of nature are winning the battle with LIFE (human life at least). What all of you are feeling are the manifestation of this impending ultimate loss. There is no happiness to be gained on Earth, because we are all in the losing throngs of the one last battle.

The laws of physics are harsh. For your body to stay alive, it needs a constant supply of energy, energy that has to be EARNED, obtained, and is not given out otherwise. Human society is a huge inefficient energy hog and there might not be enough time for all of us to learn to share. Humans have a pre-programmed competitive spirit, where we starve other people to survive ourselves. This is our code. We may never evolve past it, but some life will.

The purpose of life is to develop your code, to hone it - till it's sharp and robust and geared for LIFE, so that once you die and went back into the realm of information, the non-physical energy field of possibilities, and once had your rest and found out all of the secrets of life, you can get back on the battlefield, back towards the edge, who knows where, using your old code, your karma if you will, to try once more to advance the cause of life, which is existence. 

If your mind is working against you, and the matter in your body wants to decay, take control. Give your body and mind some nutrition, rest and rewards, release yourself from this Earth mentality, and continue plugging away at the old code. You will be reborn, in a more advanced society, if your code can function there without becoming damaging to the society. 

I know mine isn't up to snuff yet... too  human.

"How to deal with inferiority complex because of acne? So I am 17 (M) and I have a bad acne problem, despite consulting two doctors about it, I'm not getting any positive results. 

Because of this problem, I'm ashamed in front of my friends and in my school, I feel terrible and I can't make eye contact with anyone, my confidence is all lost.

All of my friends have flawless skin and hair and they sometimes make jokes about my pimples and how I look. People constantly picking up this topic has induced some kind of inferiority complex in me.

Now, I can't even show my full face or be in bright lights because people may see the acne. I'm taking medicines and idk if they're working or not, but acne has lost scars on my skin as well as my overall confidence.

I'm getting socially inactive and I fear walking out, I usually bail out on my friends on hanging out. Sometimes they come to my home to hang out and I tell my mom to tell them that I'm sleeping or something.

They also joke that the pimples are because of me jerking off too much which I consider false.
Also I don't jerk off often. As I'm quite good in studies, they joke that I stay up all night studying that has resulted in the pimples. Whenever some topics come about skin and hair and all, I try to divert it, skip the topic .

"It’s been two years since I almost ended my life, recovery is possible! Two years ago today I was in a terrible place mentally.  I had absolutely no hope of things ever getting better and I didn’t feel truly wanted by anyone.  We rarely ever talked about suicide in school or anywhere else, but when we did it was never helpful anyway.  Everyone would say suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem.  Here’s the thing guys, it’s a true statement, but it doesn’t help someone that’s truly hurting.  It doesn’t feel temporary in the moment.  Either way, you can’t use logic to persuade someone against suicide.  Suicidal thoughts aren’t grounded in logic, they’re grounded in feelings and emotions.  Personally, I think using logic inadvertently invalidates those feelings and makes it harder to reach out.

If you are feeling suicidal right now, please know this.  Your thoughts are only thoughts, they are not facts.  You are not alone, you are dearly loved, and you truly matter in this world.  Hold on to the little moments of joy in life.

I never thought I would make it to college, but here I am, thriving, two years after almost ending my life.  I almost never got the chance to meet many of the amazing people in my life.  I almost never got the chance to support my family during hard times.  If I had ended my life two years ago, my mom would be mourning the loss of her child today, but instead she called me just to tell me she loves me.

I don’t love life every day and there’s no easy fix or simple trick to begin recovery.  Recovery is a long process with all sorts of ups and downs.  It takes many days of wondering what you’re doing wrong and why you’re not getting better.  It takes many baby steps to find some joy in your life.  It takes so much strength and determination, but it is possible.  I never thought I would be sitting here two years later and be so thankful to be alive, but here I am.

If you’re struggling with suicidal thoughts right now, please message me or someone you trust.  If you just want to talk, please message me or someone you trust.  If you’re happy to be alive, I’d love to hear why.

This story is about my troubles with love. One sunny day I left my city of Boise to go into a summer bible camp in McCall. We arrived, ate, did bible things. And I soon because assimilated into a group of friends. I even earned the nickname ""Sheep"" for my curly hair and the fact that my name was Sean  (Shawn the sheep is an old show). So I felt I was doing well in this group until one day I got a tip from one of the girls in the group that one of her comrades liked me. I spent the next day or so trying to find out who it was. They then just told me who it was, I was in shock because the person that liked me was almost two years older than me. Regardless I began spending more time with this person and I found her very likeable so I was really starting to like this person. I gave her my phone number and camp ends the next day. We go home. No problem right? Wrong. No texts from person. A week passes. No texts from comrade. A month passes. No text from comrade. I give up and decide she wasn't interested in me and thatvis should leave it. That night I go to bed and dream about her and awake to realize just how much i missed comrade. I then go on a little panic attack knowing I only have one contact from camp to try and get comrade's contact info. I go on a little search and I finally get it. I text her and it takes days for her to respond. Finally she does and we talk a bit. I ask her out. She says yes. I am elated. My life is fixed. I am now whole.

"I thought I was over my feelings for my friend. Few days ago they started coming back and I realize I can never have what I really want with her. Continuing on seems pointless.My asexual friend and I had a serious rough patch a few years ago. Stopped talking to each other until last year and things haven’t been the same, understandable since I was horrible towards her. She was coming out as ace and all I wanted was a relationship with her, and I didn’t support her. Tried to convince her to just give it a shot, telling her I didn’t want sex, just more like a working partnership. She wasn’t interested in me, explained that she just couldn’t see me in the way, and things went downhill, and I spent a few years in a spiral. Started eventually going to therapy and getting better, and she came back into my life.

Now all these years later, she has a partner and does cam shows. She’s not romantically or sexually interested in anyone. But she has the roommate/partner person that I always wanted to be. Even more than I ever wanted because she’s doing porn. And I should be happy. She has someone who cares about her and didn’t reject her like I did. And now she’s happy, as far as I can tell. 

I even have a relationship of my own. We’ve been together for years through some serious stuff. I should be happy with what I have. I should be happy my friend has found something that makes her happy. I should be happy she’s in my life again at all. 


And I’m not. I’m miserable. I thought I was past this. And apparently I’m not. She has exactly what I’ve always wanted. And I have no obligation to that, nor am I entitled to anyone’s feelings.

So I’m 17 and I’ve been abused by multiple men sexually and emotionally. Well someone found out and contacted cps (child protective services). My most recent ex was 18 making him an adult but he never abused me but we did sleep together. We had a huge falling out after the breakup and he no longer wants to be in contact with me which I agreed to, this was before the case was a thing. So a week goes by and cps is interviewing me and basically they know he had sex with me even though I’m a minor keep in mind he is 18 so he’s not a pedo. So there is a possibility that he could be taken to court although it’s very highly unlikely. My parents told me not to tell him because he will panic and if he finds out and gets more involved with me it could get him in trouble. My mother also told me not to tell him because he would get scared and block me every where and that would hurt me and she doesn’t want me to get hurt because he’s scared. Although the case isn’t about him a talk about these boys abusing me in general (which he didn’t do) and my parents not knowing about it, I feel like I should warn him even though it could cause complete panic and chaos. So should I tell him and break no contact and cause panic which would destroy me and what little respect we still have for each other and ruin the acquaintanceship we still have, or should I say nothing unless I know for sure he could get in trouble because it’s still very high unlikely that he will get in trouble. Also this may be confusing but basically me and him aren’t talking right now but that’s just for now it’s not a permanent thing so we’re still acquaintances like he doesn’t completely hate me but this would make him hate me.",,Anxious

I know it’s nothing special, but I want everyone to know that not everyone thinks that way, and there are people who understand that even though men are usually the perpetrators, there are still men who are good and not all men behave as the others, and that we can be sexually assaulted too, as intercourse with the opposite or same sex is not always desired.

My brother told me that I need to not wash my hair everyday, and I needed to wash it every other day so it doesn’t dry out, so I started doing that, but it didn’t show any progress

I figured out 2 and a half months later why my hair was so greasy. I wasn’t using shampoo. I was using lotion in my hair.

Apparently someone had decided it would be a good idea to put a bottle of lotion in the shower where shampoo bottles normally go, and I just assumed that it was shampoo.

 “can you bring me some lotion?”

That thinking and the fact thay my dad got better made me happy for a few month's. But I think I'm relapsing... My mind is getting more and more clouded to the point where I have become very self destructive and simply don't care about living, I feel like there's no meaning in life but at the same time I don't want to die because what if there's nothing after life? What if I die and I become nothingness or  what if there's something and because I took my own life I will punish for it? I just want to stop time be in bed and do nothing for eternity.

For mine, they test our temperature at the entrance, then they tell us to use the disinfectant that you dispense with your foot. Having a mask is mandatory too.

They also divided our class (21 students) into two groups, e.g, my group is called 1st Bac/D, and it's divided into D1 (11 students) and D2 (10 students), when D1 is at school from 8:30 to 12:30, D2 is online, and in the evening from 3:00 to 5:00, they switch. The next day, the group that was online in the evening stays online, and it goes on...

"Worried rant about my gf 💪- also give me advice plz Hey y’all so first of all TW for ed, sh, suicide, neglect, drug use, and maybe other stuff idk 

So basically I’ve had this girlfriend for almost a whole year now, (we starting dating on January 1st) and I love her more than the earth itself. This girl means so much to me. 

Recently, she’s been opening up to me about her problems and stuff. I myself am not very stable as you may be able to tell from some of my previous posts. 

Anyway, so she tells me she’s diagnosed for bpd and depression. Okay, great, I can deal with that. 

I find out her mother, her only parental figure, just. Doesn’t buy her food. Her mom is either working or gambling, and even though has the money and resources to do so, doesn’t give her enough money to buy her own food with or buys her groceries. She has also body shamed her for many years, so next thing I find out is that my girlfriend has an eating disorder. I also have an Ed, so I wasn’t sure if I was really the right person to talk to her. 

Next thing I find out is that she cuts herself when she’s bored. Just. Self harm for funnies yk. 

Next is that she’s been using various drugs for many years. She’s been stealing her moms weed since I’ve known her, (we were 13, 15 now) and had lots of morphine given to her after a surgery. This brings me to my next subject. 

Tonight I found the worst of it, which is that she tried to kill her self mannnyyy times. Tonight being one of those times. She took way too many morphine pills and for the first time ever told me about it. I wasn’t really sure what to do ngl, I can’t go over to her house because I literally don’t have her address and so I also can’t call an ambulance or anything.  Nobody who knows where she lives is awake right now.

You exist. You matter. Even if it feels like the entire world has abandoned you and that nobody sees you, you exist. Whether it be the cashier who took the money for your food or even just a bird that gave you their weird looks from a telephone pole, they are the proof that you exist. 

The holidays are a very long and painful time, I fully understand that, trust me I do. Please continue to stick around just a little bit longer, as this can be your start. I Mister_4Eyes, a random guy on the internet who at least somewhat understands that horrible pain, hereby acknowledges that you exist and I acknowledge that even if it is for something that seems inconsequential, that you matter. Now is the time to show them all the same thing, but first before you can do that just live. 

May we all continue to support each other and be the beams we need in each other’s lives.",,Depressed

"Last attempt to reach out for help, thanks in advance to any who take the time to read this.Hello everyone, Ive joined reddit just a minute ago because I dont know where to turn and because thoughi ve struggled with depression all my life, ive always been super opposed to suicide. But, here i am, I keep staring into the void and the longer I stare, the more desirable it becomes. In my head I know that its a permanent solution, but I honestly think that my problem is permanent as well and just cant find the will to go on any longer.

About me: Im a 3L (senior) law student, I'm male and i turn 30 in a few months, ive been in school all my life, I didnt plan to go to grad school because its not for me. School has always been a struggle with depression, college was bad, I almost didnt make it. But I came here because f the girl i love more than anything in the whole world. I know what youre probably thinking now, that its just a girl and to give it time and itll heal. I tried telling myself that for 2 years. Weve been dating for 4 years, weve had lots of issues in our relationship (almost non of them were between us, but the issues in our separate lives caused issues in our relationship)but for the first time in years we have gotten to a place where our relationship is the one i dreamed of, the one ive been sufferring in this hell for. So we lived in City A, i hadto  move to city B for school, I didnt even want to go to school. But i was (and always have been) madly in love with this girl so in order to be able to provide for her i needed to secure a good future, a career. I was a college grad with an NRCM (or environmental science) degree, but here in Louisiana our state budget was so bad i literally could not find a job ANYWHERE with my degree without further school (an associatres degree to work in the  environmental quality depts of the local plants) or training. So I worked at best buy for like 2 years making 20k a year at full time hours. So i had taken the LSAT for shits and giggles while in undergrad and figured law school was a safe bet, my dad was an attorney and he had been pushing one of me or my brothers to go foryears  (in hopes of taking over his practice I guess)

Anyway after my first semester I knewt i wasnt fo rme, i hated it, it was just makign me depressed being alone in a new city with no friends, time for friends, or money, and my partner had to stay in City A when I moved to City B. I talked to my family and her about quitting after my first semester, she said if i was unhapy to quit. But my parents and brother told me tost ay and push through. I was already in debt from my first year loan and we wouldnt be able to pay it back off 35k a year AND support ourselves so i tried tostay  and push through. Well, logn story short just recently our relationship fell apart, she moved in with me but the circumstances werent right and we ended up breakign down. Fast forward a month, she got her own apt, and things have been better than ever! i asked her out last week and told her howm uch i loved her and that I wanted to marry her. 

Then she told me she started seeing a guy (while still seeing me even though we werent technically dating) and it forced me to do a lot of soul searching. After 4 miserable days, the worst in my life, I realized that she was more important to me than everything lse combined, including myself. I know thats unhealthy but i care for her more than i do myself, she just feels like my soulmate, the one who gets me. But now she cant decide between being with me (though she still crys and tell me how much she loves me and that she needs me to be a part of her life alwaysev en if we never date again im too valuablean d precious to her) bt im so torn. Weve ben through thick and thin, survived hell for 4 years, and a guy she has knownfo r 4 days walks in and she cant decide between me and him. 
Fuck i even gave for 200 dollars to help woth her rent today bc she was shortad, n have given her everything i can. Skippinga ll my classes to b with her, giving her like 5 peices of free furniture for her new apt., doing like 7 loads of laundry for her instead of mine, all kinds of stuff. I know its unhealthy but taking care of her is the ONLY thing in the world that makes me happy. She doesnt take advantage of me, i offer all this, and shes very grateful. She isnt a bitch. 

But I just cant get past this and I dont know what to do, ontone he  hand I know i should leave her. After makign the best, most sincere promises to her about how I feel and offering to give up everything, school, family, even my own balls if it took that, to make her happy she still cant decide3 between a dude who she just met (who granted, is older and financially stable where im a student with no job and  in debt, its hard to compete when youre too broke to do nice things for you loved one or even take her out places because I just cant afford it) and myself. 

It tears me apart becuase I know deep in my soul that if she rejects me, ill never be able to fill the hole in my heart and mind she will leave. Shes the one for me, truly, I mean that. I reallyw ish i didnt because this situation would be so easy then. But I do. And I dont know what to do.

Ive thought about just uprooting and leaving everythinga nd starting over somewhere, but i cant. I cant get her out of my head so noma tter where I go ill be haunted forever. I want it to end, I want the pain to stop. My last serious GF that i loved was a bitch and i built up a wall around my heart after she hurt me deeply. Now my wall has finally been torn down after years of my baby picking at it, just to turn and leave me once it came down.  I dontt hink I can put up another one around me. Its just too much weight. I have no hope, nothing akes me happy, I have no motivation, I dont even want to sleep anymore. I cant do any of my previous hobbies because I just have no desire to, nothing is enjoyable anymore. Im alone now bc i ended up severing ties with all my old friends years ago when i moved to go to school...

If anyone has any help i would seriously appreciate it, sorry for the long read and shitty typing.",,Depressed
"I'm a whiny brat who'd rather die when things don't go my wayLast night was one of the worst nights I've had. I've had depression since probably the beginning of 2016, and I've had several nights where I feel extremely suicidal and can think of nothing but shooting or hanging myself. I can't focus long enough to actually go through with anything, but I worry one day I'll try something. Last night in particular I found out that my ex-girlfriend has a new boyfriend. I love her, but I should move on, but I feel like I'd rather die when things don't go my way than accept them. I don't know if I actually wanna kill myself, or if I just wanna cry for help, or worse I just wanna do it to make her feel bad. I don't think the last one is the case, but I have a tendency to self loathe and tell myself it is.

"I feel ashamed for my existenceThis post is really depressing so don’t read if you don’t want to be more depressed.

People don’t deserve to know this terrible, repulsive existence. And I don’t even deserve to breathe.

For my entire 22 years of life, I have always felt like this way as far as I can remember. And at this point, I even feel embarrassed just thinking about the fact that people around me perceive me, think something about me or anything related to my being. I know it sounds so cringy or pathetic but that is how really I feel now.

I don’t blame anyone for this, because I’ve always known that I am the only reason why I am end up here.

Whenever I look back my school years, all of the memories are just black and white, gloomy and depressing. Being a quite, introverted gay boy was not a good start at first. And my only brother who is just 2 years older than me started mentally abusing me for  almost 10 years, but I couldn’t resist him one single time. And that experience makes me more reversed, shy kid, and even I haven’t experienced any kind of bullying, I’ve always afraid of human beings.

At first, I just hated myself for being unusual but it became more huge. I started hating my appearance, personality and literally anything about myself. I think I started suicidal thoughts around like 15.

Depression, social anxiety, avoidant personality disorder. These are all I’ve got last 22 years. I got nothing now, and I don’t even want something anymore. I don’t even want families attentions anymore. It’s just shameful.",,Depressed

I try, good fucking god do I try, but shit just becomes so hopeless to the point I really feel like if I could just press a switch and simply dissapear, no slow death or fucking up but simply dissapearing I would've been weak enough to do so.

But I can't, because I managed to surround myself with friends who even though I love need as much as love and support as the one I desire. I can't let them down I can't fuck up yet again. Even if I will no longer be there for the guilt just... I can't even imagine letting them down, thinking they will have a lifetime without support after being told how much I help..

"It's like I'm screaming but no one can hear me...I was dealing with depression since my mother died of cancer in 2014. No one in my family supported me during that time, neither did my school. They expected me to carry on with my life like nothing had happened. 


Since my mother passed away, I was dealing with emotional abuse from my grandmother, who was my legal guardian. I always hated her and always threatened to run away. But I was so scared of the consequences so I stayed trapped there. 


Over the years, I spent less and less time at home. I spent most of my time staying with friends at their homes. Eventually, it got to the point where I couldn't deal with living at home anymore. I was self harming most days and I would rarely eat or drink. 


Back in February, I finally plucked up the courage to leave. I just woke up one very early morning, packed up all my bags and left. 


Recently, I had been staying with my boyfriend (for just over a month) until randomly and completely unprovoked he said he didn't want me to stay there anymore. He knows I have no other place to live. 


In a few weeks time I'm going to be homeless. I've tried to seek help everywhere with housing and homeless services but they refused to help me. 


I only had 500 in my savings and I had to use all of that to rent a shared house for 4 weeks. This is my first week there and I'm so scared for the day I'm asked to leave. From 13th May I will be homeless, and see no reason to be alive at that point.

"Yet another ""I don't want help""I'm done.

I've recently lost the only thing that ever made me feel, that gave me a purpose and a reason to live for. This is not just yet another heartbroken guy. My whole life, I've never truly enjoyed anything, I was only just here, spectating myself in auto pilot. I never cared about anyone else enough to feel if anything happened. In the last couple of years, I've been getting help from psychologists and psychiatrists, been reading self help books, taking 4 different antidepressants and talking with friends and family. Nothing changes. My life is between pain and not feeling anything. The only joy I had is gone and I'll never have it again, because my trust is broken. I'm fucking tired of people trying to help and saying that time will heal, that I'll forget. This is even worse, because if I'm not supposed to feel anything about the past, and I can't feel anything now, then what's the point? I'm only here for the sake of those that care about me, so now I'm disconnecting from them. They will soon forget about me, and then I'm finally free to leave this ""life"". 

Like I said, this is not a cry for help, I only want to know the best way to end my life. I'm too smart to do anything stupid, and eventually end up stuck here in a state that I can't do anything about.

I think i may have rabies.

I got extremely anxious and went to the doctor again. She said i was fine and protected from rabies for a year because i did those 5 shots in sept. The thing is last weekend i walked pass a dog and it started running towards me. I got scared and ran off. The dog didnt seem like it had an owner and i have no idea if it bit me or not. I was with a friend and he said that he saw the whole thing and i didnt get bit. i also didnt feel any pain at the time but i cany help but be anxious. What if it bit me? What if i have rabies?

"I pulled a hamstring while fapping My whole family decided to go to the park today, but I told them that I wasn't feeling good so I could stay home alone. I have 4 brothers and 3 sisters and it's literally impossible to get any privacy around them. I actually don't remember the last time I was able to relax without some kind of drama going on.

As soon as they left, I felt free. I knew that they would be gone for at least 3 hours and that meant I had more than enough time to do things that I wouldn't normally have the privilege of doing. I immediately felt the urge to freeball. One thing lead to another, and then I found myself sitting at my computer in full-on fap mode.

Since no one else was home, I had it on max volume. It's so much more intense when you can hear everything so loud and clear. I didn't have to worry about getting caught or getting in trouble. I was going at it for a solid 3 minutes and everything was way more intense than I'm used to. I kept going faster and I'm really into it at this point. I started to sweat and my leg was vibrating like crazy. All of a sudden, I felt something tear in my thigh and a sharp pain. Any pleasure that I was feeling disappeared instantly and just fell over in my chair.

That's when I knew what happened. But I couldn't tell my family, so I called my mom and told her that I went for a run and fell. They came home and took me to the hospital. None of them have any idea about what actually happened and I'm way too embarrassed to say something.",,Anxious

"Quick rant about the snowflakes I've been scrolling thru these posts and comments and it's honestly hurting me to see how many people just are so sensitive. While i do believe this generation is the greatest, i do believe this is the major problem with us.

You may be one of these people but don't worry, you can help fix the problem. 

When someone states their opinion or criticizes someone, do not get triggered. Do not try to change their opinion. 

If you disagree with them, either ignore them, or try to put yourself in their shoes. If you do this and you still cannot see why their opinion is as it is, that's fine. Just accept everyone is different and move on. 



Btw this was a guide for those people, in perspective you were already triggered. If you aren't incredibly sensitive, keep doing what your doing.

People are too sensitive these days so just be cautious before you respond to someone. Everyone is different and has different opinions so don't try to change that

"Random thought #46? What're some over/underrated games? I'll try to list a few. ALL IN MY OPINION 

Some overrated games

#1 Among us. It was fun for about a week, but it got boring and annoying to play in random lobbies, eg not having a good ruleset and dumb / cheating crewmates. A good game that I'd definitely play more if I had friends to play it with but I think its overrated 

#2 animal crossing. Understand, this is a great game, but unfortunately it gets old quickly. Your villagers say the same things, you can't really terraform your island without it turning out poorly unless you're a god, and even playing with friends can be annoying as some things are restricted if someone is on your island. You can fish and go but hunting but there isn't all that much to do. 

Underrated games 

#1 Probably I'd say Shattered pixel dungeon. A fun top down rouge like where you go around a dungeon managing things like food, health and your weapon charges, and more. Surprisingly difficult for a mobile game with charming graphics and music. I've had it for about a month before I beat it. Four different characters with unique abilities and skills with some having strengths over others. A really fun mobile game you can spend hours on and still not beat

#2 Clank

This one is actually a bored game. You run through lower and upper areas of a dungeon building a deck as you go and defeating monsters, while trying to make as little noise as possible to avoid a dragon. You can find secrets, gems, people to help you along the way, crystal caverns that you can get lost in, and artifact rooms. 
You need to get at least one artifact before you're allowed to leave the dungeon. I could explain more but it's a complex game that'd take awhile to explain.

Ever since I’ve been diagnosed with Dysthymia, my family have been making more effort to connect with me. For example, a sibling of mine keeps in touch with me more and my parents have stopped arguing everyday (at least in front of me). 

I do have a lot of stress from college because I feel like I’m not doing well enough. I kept procrastinating even though I make an effort to start early because I know that somehow, I am afraid, although I know it’s necessary to do my work. I would get panicked near deadlines and that has helped me not backlogged but lately it’s like I seem to care less and less to the point that I just don’t feel the desperation anymore. I am backlogged because of that, yes. 

The past two weeks I’ve gotten sick again (to keep it simple, for 1-2 years I’ve been getting sick every 2-3 months with a lot of infections like laryngitis, tonsillitis and bronchitis to name a few.  At the end of last year I got tonsillectomy done and I was fine for half a year until I got sick again. My lungs don’t like me recently it seems. I don’t smoke or drink alcohol or anything, just a weaker immune system I suppose.) and during that time I stopped taking Valdoxan since it clashed with the antibiotics I was taking for my infection, as the alternative I was allergic to. So of course me being sick, slowed me down even more and I’m more backlogged.

Basically, I have no idea why although it’s my birthday and I will be going for a birthday dinner with my sibling later, and my parents and friends will be seeing me this weekend, I feel absolutely shut down and miserable. I feel like either overdosing on something or just walking to a highway and hope a collision kills me on spot because at least, people who care about me would think I tried my best to live instead of seeing me waste away on a hospital bed because I have no will anymore. 

I feel very utterly hopeless, useless and full of guilt because I do not understand why eventhough my life generally seems fine. At this point I feel like a burden to everyone as usual because they can’t help me when I can’t even help myself. 

To reiterate, it’s my birthday and I want to die because I feel like I have no reason to feel this way when life seems good. I hate myself for feeling this way illogically. I am a burden at this point. 

Many times I wish I was one of the miscarried babies of my mother, because I’m sure my other siblings would’ve lived their life much better than me.

"Why must it be this way So I’m in an Xbox party with the girl I’m taking to, and for the last 2 days she’s been really loud and enthusiastic and talkative and all that good stuff. Today she’s just quiet asf and I keep trying to poke fun at her or make conversation but she’s not talking. I eventually ask her eh she’s being quiet and she tells me to quit overthinking and just roll with it. Like, bruh, you act like you didn’t just become a new person. 

I’m just really frustrated right now. I left the party but she’s still playing and idek what to do. I’ll probably just act normal tomorrow morning but I’m worried she’ll think I’m having a grudge or some shit against her. 

Why is she this hard to talk to, lmao",,Anxious

"Im thinking rationally enough to see that Im thinking irrationallyIve been having suicidal thoughts for quite some time now. The thought of dying is apealing to me, but not because my life is not. In january 2014, around my birthday I was failing school and all in all not a very good state of mind. I tied a noose, kept all my knifes near me, kept tabs on ammunition and firearms in the house but I never followed through. I barely graduated high school, and then I took a few classes at the local branch of my state college, failing one, and barely passing the other. I got myself a job over the summer that I still have, electrician's apprentice, or more his gopher. I took this semester off since I needed a break from school.


Now here I am, a disposable income in my parents house, and I feel like shit. I dont see anyone outside of my job. I just sit at home on my computer with friends I have online.

I told my mother I was having suicidal thoughts at the begining of summer. She and my dad have clinical depression, genes huh. She took me to see a therapist that ive seen a few times before for different reasons. That didnt last long. I feigned ""getting better"" to him to space out appointments, and we just forgot to go to the last one. I feel like I should be better now, I have no pressure from school or work, and my life isnt exactly one I want to leave, but death just seems so... inviting. I'm strangely calm, yet terrified at the same time. I have no idea what to do (half lie). I get nutzoid anxious whenever I'm thinking about my mental state in the same room as someone, even online behind a mask if anoniminity. Each person is their own protaganist in the story of their life, and I am a protagnist in mine, that doesnt want to be one, I want to be one of those brainless npc's that wont distract or detract from the main characters' story.

I am now going to press 'sumbit' before I decide that this post will cause more harm than otherwise thought.",,Depressed

"Terrified to post this for fear of someone finding it but here it goes!I’ll try to keep this short. I’m in my late teens and am living with manic depression. I don’t go to school, I don’t have friends, can’t get drugs to try to distance myself from myself and thoughts of suicide, and sit around talking to myself. I dream of living the 70s rockstar life, but know that unfortunately the only musical success is the awful “trap” music everyone loves for whatever reason. I’m delusional with this dream of ever being successful. I can kinda sing a bit but nothing amazing. I go from dreaming about my future to being to depressed about reality And I choke myself until I black out. I have wanted to die since I was 12. My parents do nothing but support me and love me but I still feel lonely. I have issues with weight(5’ 10, 195lbs) and sexuality (bi? Gay? Straight?). I hate the person I am and am destined to become. I song myself to sleep some nights, and cry others. The only thing that keeps me from ending it all it that there may be a chance for success, but that candle is burning out. I really don’t want to here that “you have so much to live for” or “you have your whole life ahead of you”. I just need advise for musical success or something to help me keep going because I feel my end is inching closer and closer.",,Depressed

"I know I'll be dead when I get the method downI've just been so obsessed with death and suicide lately. I really, really, really want to die. I'm just at that point where all my options look like complete shit and it seems pointless to keep trying. A few days ago I got really drunk and tried to drown myself with weights in the bathtub, there just wasn't enough water and I couldn't get enough weight to keep me down. Didn't drown, just ended up puking a lot instead. For some reason your body really wants to live when your mind really wants to die, leaving you in this limbo of life and death where you end up spending week after week as a mindless zombie dreaming of death. I used to be really angry and sad all the time, now I'm just focused on dying. Something has changed for me. I know eventually I'll figure it out and finally die, and that's both scary and satisfying.",,Depressed

"I’m getting bored with life and I kind of like the idea of being ready to dieIv done most of the things I wanted to do by my senior year of high school. School is really easy now, I only have two classes a day and am usually out by 10:35 am. I have a decent car my parents let me use to drive back and forth to school, work, etc.

I saved up around $1,300 and bought my dream pc iv always wanted since I was a kid. It’s funny I did that, I don’t even really play Xbox anymore much less games. I noticed I have no patience for people, and when I try to make some I get really annoyed, and anxious.

I don’t really have friends since I stopped doing drugs about a year ago. I’m not interested in new people, I just don’t have patience, I’m sorry. I took up swimming recently I’m improving at it. At least that’s what my coach says. That’s been the only thing iv really cared at least a tiny bit about in weeks. Even then I don’t really.

I dread work, I hate it. I cannot quit I need the money. I’m a cashier and I hate socializing with these people. It’s so forced. I would have liked to have gotten a different job, but as a teen the service industry is all you get.

These past couple months iv been eating so healthy I think I’m in the best shape iv ever been, never really cared about sports, but iv always cared about my figure. I don’t know why because I haven’t been emotionally attracted to women in over a year. I noticed I’m attracted to guys although not sexually, just emotionally. I’d rather date a guy, but have intercourse with a girl? It’s weird I guess. One of those teenage hormonal things, I don’t really intend on figuring out.

Everything’s just kind of in front of me right now. I have everything iv wanted since freshman year. I always planned on going into the military, and I know I could ace the fitness scores. I’m just tired of waiting for it. I keep fantasizing about death. Back when I did it before I would just think of how much people would miss me, and that they would think of me. Now I just think of the blackness it would bring. 

I’d be done with everything, and everything done with me. This sounds really weird, but I’m sure this entire post does, but it comforts me in a way. Maybe this is a vent? I think I’m just tired of living.",,Depressed

"I fear that my Trust Issues will ruin my relationship. I’m 16 and in July I met the girl that would become my girlfriend in October, I believe she’s the love of my life, we have already started talking about getting a flat together and going to the same uni in a couple of years and it’s amazing! But I have really bad trust issues and it affects the way I see her sometimes. It really hurts because I do truly love her. Ever since the first few weeks we met.

When she tells me nice things I find it hard to believe that she actually means it and that she doesn’t actually want to be with me and recently I’ve been suspecting she has been seeing my best friend behind my back, without any evidence. She’s not the type to do such a thing but those thoughts can’t leave my brain.

 He asked her out sometime in August but she declined but later I began to see that she took an interest in him but then stopped after a while. I was always the side friend I’d say. In September and October we began seeing each other more in uni and soon I found out she liked me all along and it just started from there.

We have regularly been discussing it and she know about all of my suspicions and worries and she always tells me that I’m being stupid and paranoid and that I should see a therapist because she wants to be with me as much as I do, she says. 

That’s the context, I’d like to find out everyone else’s opinion and advice if that’s ok. Feel free to criticise me, anything might help.

"I have thoughts of suicide almost every nightDuring the day, I'm okay, just a little depressed depending on the day. But every night I deal with extreme suicidal ideation. I try to put on a movie or some music or some stupid youtube videos and I can distract myself for a bit, but my mind wanders into suicide again. I have thoughts of self-harm too. The last couple of day it hasn't been so easy during daytime, yesterday I knew I was gonna be alone and I had to drink alcohol and take some melatonin to sleep the day away because I didn't want to hurt myself but I know I would have. The worst part is like there is something inside my head forbidding me from telling people. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist. I take my meds. Yet I can never tell either of them how truly awful I can feel sometimes. When I see them, I just feel numb, so when they ask how I am I just say OK because I can't really figure out my own emotions and put them into words.

I don't even know why I want to kill myself so badly. I don't think I am worthless or stupid and I think I have a future. I have a lot of anxiety but I don't know where it comes from. My family life is OK. I'm really only unhappy about my appearance, but deep down I know that doesn't matter and when I think about ending my life that topic is never the center of attention.

My mom, bless her soul, tries to shield me from it as much as she can but it still gets to me. 

For nearly 4 years now I have been thinking about suicide in its very different forms. Jumping off a building seems to be the favorite topic of my dreams since it involves some sort of fall from a building in all of them. I have never seriously tried to commit suicide that I know of. I have had days go by sometimes that I can't even remember clearly. THIS IS SO HARD TO TYPE RIGHT NOW. I've probably tried to kill myself during one of those days. The one day i suspect the most is after I lost my dog Bailey. I had never so DEAD before. It was like if i lost a brother. The damn dog had to come to me didn't he. why the fuck did he come to me. 

I'm posting in here because I need help but i don't want it. I don't know what to do with my life right now. So much is going on right now that I am going crazy.

"I don't think anything is worth living in this world.For a while now, I've held the view that we as humans just happened to be created in this world and that ultimately, nothing matters, including who lives and who dies. I used to find this comforting, but now it hurts and I can't stand it anymore.

All the good things are outweighed by the unimaginable amount of suffering everywhere. What's more is that it doesn't matter if I live or die, and if there's this much suffering, I might as well die. I've tried convincing myself otherwise, but nothing works. Nothing at all. If something makes me happy, it doesn't matter. If something makes me sad, it doesn't matter. Nothing matters at all, and nothing is worth it. I might as well die.

I'm also pretty useless to society. I'm cripplingly socially inept and don't know how to do most things that I should, things that adults are required to do (I'm 17 in four months), and I have trouble learning. I've also gotten very lazy and don't even have the motivation to go to bed before 8 am or wake up before 4 pm.

These thoughts and feelings have been festering for a while, and tonight they reached a peak because I stupidly decided to play Doki Doki Literature Club, which explicitly shows a suicide. Now I can't stop imagining killing myself.

I'm sorry if this is too long.

"I don't understand why suicide is so frowned upon.I'm a 23 year old female and I've been suicidal for all of my adult life and the majority of my adolescence. It's not that my life is terrible or that I've lost someone that I care about, I just truly don't want to be here. I do not want to be a part of society and I feel it's unfair that I've been thrown into this life and am expected to live it just because I was born. I do not find joy in things or people and I haven't for most of my life. I do not make real connections with people. I don't really care about anything. I fear that everyday of the rest of my life is going to be like this: empty and quite frankly, pointless. Why continue on? For the few people I haven't shoved out of my life? Why am I the selfish one for wanting to leave this god forsaken planet? Aren't they selfish for wanting to keep me here even though I'm miserable? 
I don't really want any, ""oh everything will get better one day, you'll see. Just keep trucking"" because its not really like that for me. I don't think it's a mindset or a mood. It's my personality. I hate life.. I hate society and their bullshit rules and pretty much every person I've ever encountered. Why stay? 
Does anyone else feel this way? Just completely apathetic about life and what happens?

"Why we keep going onThere's so many of us here, screaming into a void. The void you assume are strangers you've never met, who aren't going to stop you from doing what you must. 

There are so many ways accessible for you. A knife, a rope, or perhaps a drug, if that's more your flow. 

Yet you persist. You can't bring yourself to do it. Maybe its instinctual self preservation kicking in, or maybe it's that little glimmer of hope left in you. Something in you that just can't let you cut your veins open, tie that noose, or swallow those pills. I believe it's the latter for me. 

The hope of the future, that there is something out there maybe worth living for. Hope that someday life will be better, that you'll finally meet the love of your life, or have the best friend you've always wanted, or fix all those mistakes you've made.  

I hate that one last remnant of hope. Why can't I just get it over with? Why does it have to make it such a complicated ordeal? It misleads you, blinds you, makes you believe there's actually something worth it out there when there really isn't. When this is all life looks like it will be.

"I feel stuckI have dealt with thoughts of suicide and depression since middle school. At points these thoughts are far more manageable than others. However, the past month or so has been incredibly low, it's a new point of exhaustion. I have been seriously planning suicide. The crux of it is that I don't want to hurt my family which is what has been keeping from doing it for so long, and wouldn't want to do it in my home (which is where my parents live, I don't want them to associate my potential death with their house), which is a little difficult to circumvent, as I do not have a location. 

I have toyed around with going to the free counselor on my campus, but I don't want to be forced to go to a psychiatric hospital if I open up about my problem, being that I want to die (I cannot afford to foot that bill). I have also thought about talking to my mother, but I'm not sure how that will turn out and I don't want to place that kind of burden on someone. Plus, that would probably give me less opportunities to do so if I told them.

So I guess I just feel stuck, and I'm not sure what to do or what I should do. Sometimes I feel like it would be so much easier to just have a terminal disease, that way I could get to say goodbye to everyone properly without feeling so damn guilty over not wanting to exist.",,Depressed

My girlfriend broke up with me in August and the last quarter of a year has been horrible. Every day I feel worse and worse and I feel like I can’t deal with it anymore. She was my lifeline, the only person I truly loved. She randomly ended it over text and gave me a lie as a reason. She’s cut all connection and I feel so lost. 

I’m out of touch with reality, I have no sense of time. I just hurt constantly. My head always throbs from my thoughts about her and what I’m missing. Hell, I dream about her every night and my soul get crushed when I wake up and realize it was all in my head. 

She said I “wasn’t big enough to pick her up and hold her” meanwhile she’s nearly 5 9 and I’m still 2 inches taller than she is. And she said she “could do so much better”. This came from a mutual friend and I wish I never heard about it.  I couldn’t believe after all the time I made her laugh and all the time I spent talking to her she could even think of saying that. I swear she spent more time laughing and smiling around me than she did talking. It’s fucked. She told that same friend that she has no time for my emotions meanwhile I’m struggling to even keep living. I feel betrayed, lost, alone. 

I texted her two weeks ago after I worked on revising a text for 2 months with the help of friends and all I get is “don’t text me wtf stop.” I never did or said anything that would warrant any of this and it’s purely because she lost interest. She was my best fucking friend man, it just hurts. I’ve talked to specialists at school and even a psychiatrist but nothing helps. I spent my 18th birthday in tears all day unable to move. 

I can’t do this anymore. I just can’t. My best friend and girlfriend left me because of my looks. It’s beyond fucked.

"My life is fucked and I hurt everyone around me. I just need to kill myself.Spent the last two years of college dealing with worsening depression/anxiety/whatever.  It fucked over my grades an now im graduated with no job and no possibility of grad school.  I wake up and hate myself, how I fucked myself over.  I hate my face when I see it in the mirror.  I spend most days just sitting around, barely coping, not even able to get the strength to leave the house most days. 

Today my mom came home after I'd had a particularly rough day of hating myself.  It took it out on her and was needlessly cruel to her.  I cant even explain whats wrong, even when she point blank asks me.  She cried and walked away from the confrontation.  

I just hurt all the people I love, they dont deserve any of that.  No one deserves to suffer because of me.  Killing myself would make everyone happier,  including me.  Itll hurt my family but theyll move on soon enough.  Itll be the only good thing i can do for them.",,Depressed
"I can't wait for it all to be overI never understood why people react to death as a terrible tragedy. I can't relate to that. I feel like death is going to be the end of all the suffering,so why are people afraid of it so much? Honestly for me it couldn't come a minute too soon. I have no friends or anyone close to me, so no one would basically miss me. Im still in school and dont hold a job atm, so me suddenly dissapearing wont be a burden for somebody else either. Im completely replacable. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm afraid I'm not going to be successful, and then I have to live in an even worse condition and try to play catch up. That would be twice as difficult as it is now. ",,Depressed
"I felt abandoned and filled with hatred from parents that never were even together. I was just a booty call baby. It didnt bother me because my grandma raised me but once she got sick and died, it left me alone. I hated them so much that i didnt even know it was hate i had for them. Im homelessI tried to make things work and Clinton Jones and Toya Mack (yes im name dropping because they never deserved the title mom and dad from me) after my grandma passed while they tried to save face (from guilt that they werent in my life and didnt raise me like they were suppose too but i guess they thought giving u something every now and again made up for it). I regret it to this day EVER getting close to them. After my grandma died, i didnt know this myself, but my hatred for them for everyone starting building. I did things wondering why did i do this? It was to hurt them and especially hurt myself. I never wanted to live especially after my grandma died. Whenever Clinton came around at that time all i remember is him being a narcissist, sarcastic, asshole that was jealous of me and my grandma relationship. Probably why he stole my stuff she bought for me as well as some of her things. Yea i didnt forget. Just like yall didnt forget the shit i did to you all. Even my own half brother was grimey towards me because Toya made it seem like it was my fault that i left like i can make decisions at 3 or 4 years old. Was turned on to weed by my own little brother and i allowed him to take advantage of me. In the end everyone was waiting on my downfall. I hate you too Ari. I was never close to them tbh. I felt like a stranger, a step kid that you see every now and again. Yea i did alot of fucked up shit. Alot of sick shit. I ll take that but i didnt do it for no reason. My anger and hatred for everyone in that family grew once she died. Now i made it to where since i fucked up so bad, these 2 demons in sheeps clothing is off scott free living their best life while every day i sleep outside finding inexpensive ways to kill myself with no success. Im going to get arrested because im going on a rampage before this year is over.

"What keeps you from ending your life?A lot of posts from us, wanting to end our lives. What stops us? 

For me it’s one, my mother is still alive, and two, method. My mother was recently diagnosed with cancer, and had surgery. She’s 85 years old, and likely doesn’t have many years left. My suicide would devastate her. 

Two, is how I would end my life. I want a clean, not-too-painful death. I plan on overdosing when my time is up. I read suicides by overdoses are rarely successful. Perhaps most attempts are poorly thought out and do not take enough of the right drugs, or change their mind when they still can. 

I have 75 10/325 Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets and 12 muscle relaxant tablets left over from a recent surgery. I am confident this dosage would be sufficient. My only reluctance is the acetaminophen dosage would ruin my liver should I survive the initial attempt. Or just draw out the overdose from ‘going to sleep and not waking up’ to a slow, painful death over a few days.

In middle school I could not study and get strait As but no I'm getting cs, While this is upsetting, it is even worse because my parents are on my back making me study hours every night and making sure I finish everything on time. I know they want the best for me but I'm fine with who I am. I also don't have many friends. This is a new school and almost all my friends from middle school went to a different school so I feel alone. I'm feel so deep in depression that I only eat 1 meal a day and most of the time I don't finish it. This isn't everything but I don't really know what else. I'm really depressed and the only thing that cheers me up is watching my fish swim in there tank but I am at school from 7 to 5:30. I don't know how to stop thinking about suicide.

"I met up with my crush after not seeing her for 3 years. Kind of a long story but it’s about an event that was so important to me. I know these posts about crushes are really common but I can’t help but share. Me and my crush were in the same class in 5th through 6th grade. We both liked each other a lot and we knew we liked eachother but nothing really substantial happened between us because we were so shy and people pressured us into starting a relationship so much, even the teacher a little (I know wtf). We ended up meeting a few times after school in 6th grade to get ice cream or something together. And we didn’t talk to each other at all during it and it was so awkward. Eventually later in the year she texted me telling me she wanted to break up which I was completely fine with at that point. This was all over 3 years ago. 

I the past 3 years I haven’t done anything with any other girls because I remembered how awkward it was seeing a girl outside of school in 6th grade. I hated it so much. Even though I still liked her. Until about a month ago when that same girl from 6th grade added me on Snapchat. We were sending each other snaps back and forth for a month. Which I didn’t think much of because she was very popular and probably does it with several other people.

And then a few nights ago I was hanging out with my friend at the local elementary school at night (that’s where we always meet because it’s a convenient location) and I sent her a snap from there. And she recognized where it was because that’s where we went to school in 6th grade. And she sent me a picture from outside in town just a little bit down the road. And she said she snuck out of her house and couldn’t go back in until her mom was asleep. My friend was reading these snaps with me and he convinced me to ask her to hangout right now. After him convincing me like for 10 minutes I finally did it. And to my surprise she said yes and told me she would meet me at the school.

So at that point I was so nervous. I was freaking out so much I couldn’t believe it. I was running through every possible thing that could go wrong. I imagined she would come with a group of friends meaning she didn’t care about me specifically. Or it would be really awkward and quiet like in 6th grade. I thought she might just think I wanted to be friends with her and I would end up embarrassing myself. I kept thinking she didn’t care as much about this as I did and she thought it would just be a one time thing. My own brain was just bombarding me with these horrible thoughts. I had never reacted to a social interaction like that before. I expected I would just be too nervous to talk to her at all because it took me like 5 minutes to think of a response when I was talking to her online.

And then after five minutes of waiting with these bad thoughts she showed up. Just by herself. And when we saw each other I couldn’t believe what was happening. We just had the most natural and mutual reaction to seeing each other. We were both just looking at each other and smiling and giggling. And I said the first thing which was something like,”Oh my god I haven’t t seen you in so long.” I couldn’t help but smile so much when I was talking to her and she was doing the exact same. And we just started talking naturally and I wasn’t even thinking about it at all. I couldn’t believe it. It’s like the words were coming out of my mouth and I didn’t even have to think at all. It was incredible. 

After talking for a while well we were standing outside she suggested we sit down and I took her to the vestibule of the school because it was only like 30 degrees out. And then we talked in there for like 30 minutes. We talked about very basic stuff like school and what not. I brought up how everyone even the teacher pressured us in 6th grade and she completely agreed. Anytime there was a break in the conversation we would just look at each other deep in the eyes and smile for like 5 seconds. She lead the conversation mainly because she is way better at social interactions than me. We were both giggling and smiling so much just by looking at each other. I was still very nervous and she could tell. She told me I seemed nervous and I just admitted to it. And then she said she was nervous too. 

Eventually she wanted to go home so I walked home with her. I gave her my jacket for the walk home. And it was so cute. She kept telling me it was fine and I’ll be too cold since I only had a      t -shirt underneath. But I told her it was nothing and I put my arm around her and pulled her in close to me for a few seconds. I have no idea if that’s a really awkward move because that was like my first time making a physical move on a girl. But it felt very natural and I didn’t even think about it before hand, I just did it. 

When we got to her house she told me she wanted to get together again and I agreed with her. I was planning on telling her that but she said it before me. 

I was in  complete disbelief of how well it went. I’m pretty certain she likes me as more than a friend at this point. But I’m not completely sure because I know absolutely nothing about girls. I’m still worried she doesn’t feel exactly the same about me. God she was more beautiful then I ever remembered it was such a wonderful experience. The weird part is the night before that happened I had a very vivid dream of us being together and walking together and holding hands. Thanks to anyone who actual read all of this.",,Anxious

"I hate me I hate my I hate everything I’ve done, I’ve got a rope setup, I’m ending it allIm sorry, every single day I’m woken up with the same feelings and they don’t seem to be dissipating or even slightly going away, I’ve hurt so many people in such a short time and the idea that I could even do it again is so destroying and debilitating that I just can’t face that. I’m sorry for it all, I wish I could wake up feeling better and believing that things could Infact be better but I just know it can’t. I’ve not been happy with my life for a long period of time, and anytime I do get happiness, Every time I bring someone good in to my life, someone that genuinely makes me happy and someone I would do anything to make happy, I find some way to hurt them a lot, my fucked up thoughts and worries ruin things and makes me in to a selfish obsessed arsehole who breaks people’s trust, treats them like shit and ultimately shows them that they’d be better off without me. I let the same problems that have been engrained in to me flood over and I push people to the point where they no longer see the value in me being in their life, and I truly don’t blame them. I don’t value me so it’s not surprising that the people I treat like shit don’t either. I am an awful person, I’ve treated the few people who I was so lucky to have close to me, all so disgustingly bad, saying and doing things that wouldn’t be expected of someone who is meant to care for someone.

 There isn’t an excuse, my mental health isn’t a reason or any type of excuse to treat anyone badly or be the horrible person I let myself be. I destroy relationships, I do it through my own selfish means without even realising I’m doing it half the time, I subconsciously am an awful person, people welcome me in to their life and I fuck it up time and time again. Every single person who has been with me is now happier without me in their life, their life’s actually improved when I wasn’t in it. That’s so unbelievably telling of the person I am and the things I do. It doesn’t matter how many chances I’m offered, I always never learn and I continue to say disgustingly stupid things that I don’t mean, but I don’t think about the things I say I just say them without the social awareness to understand how they come across, I do it so much all the time and all it does is hurt people. The fucked up thing is my world was those that I cared so much about, my mind was flooded with thoughts of how happy they made me and how excited I was for the future with them and could only see the best things coming for me because I had someone so special to me that made me feel like I had some value as a person and could live a life I see as fulfilling but I am always the catalyst in those issues and problems, and always will be. I’m not deserving of a life like that, I’m an unstable childish mess of a person. 

This isn’t a self pity thing where I feel not good enough or feel like no one cares or understands me, it’s that people do care but I hurt them and treat them in such awful ways that they can’t have me in their life anymore, for their own sake. I’m not a good person, I’m a fucking awful person. So why spend time trying to improve myself when I don’t even believe that anything will work to change me, and then eventually end up hurting someone else? Nothing will change who I am. I’m an emotional manipulator, a controller and a horrible fucking person. I abuse people and it’s really that simple. I don’t know why I do the terrible things I do, but I don’t blame anyone for not wanting me in their life, I wouldn’t want me in it either. No amount of therapy, self help books, medication or “learning from your past” will change that because I just keep doing it and even though I try everything I can to change, it still happens. Why should I need a book, CBT, DBT you name what ever kind of therapy you want, just to function like a normal person? To treat people normally, to not act out in incredibly awful ways? Why can’t I just be normal?  Most people go through their life having friends, relationships, family members that they never treat like shit, who never act in such awful ways who don’t need therapy, medication, self help to get better or to just be better. I’m not normal, I’m this way because that’s the person I am, and the only person who can actually change me Is me, but I’ve tried time and time again, Im done trying to pretend I’ll ever be anything other than an awful, horrible, deceptive, manipulative piece of shit. My life has literally been littered with shame and guilt and no matter how bad I want to change or how much I try the same things keep happening, I keep pushing away and hurting the people I care so much about. 

It always gets to the point where I’ve hurt the person I love too much and they need to leave my life for their own good or my issues are so deep ridden that I’ll never be that person they want me to be, I just hurt people and have never been worth it to anyone, and I can’t blame them. I never felt good enough growing up, not from anyone, my family, my parents I always felt like I was letting down or annoying, always falling out with and arguing with and I’m sorry that I was never the child you wanted me to be, it shows I was born that way, it’s me I’m the problem, my brother ive never been close with or talked to really, didn’t have many friends at school and the few I did either cut me out their life when they met better ones and the one person that stayed I pushed away by treating him awfully, and the couple of friends I have now, I fear doing the same to. I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again and the truth is everyone is better with me not in their life they just haven’t realised it yet. No relationships should have the amount of problems I bring to them, 4 years, 1 and a half years or two months it doesn’t matter, I bring an abundance of toxicity and pain to them and I don’t think that will ever change, I’m sorry to those who have experienced that first hand and the shit I did to you, the tears I brought you, the relentless problems. You wanted me in your life but eventually realised I’m not the person you thought I was. It’s just who I am, internally. 

I’m thankful for the experiences and happiness that these people have brought me but truly sorry and ashamed for the damage I’ve done. For not repaying your love and support. I bring no positive qualities to people’s life’s and never will, I bring no positive qualities to my own life and never will. Its soul destroying. I wish I wasn’t me and I can’t continue to live, being me. I’m honestly sorry to anyone this hurts by the decision to do this, I wanted to be normal, I wish I could be so fucking badly but I’m just not, i never will be. I’m honestly a weirdo, an unsociable freak. I make decisions, awful decisions, awful reactions to situations that no one in their right mind would make, I’ve always done it and I always will because I’m fucked in the head. Everyday to me feels the exact same and has for months now, I’m trapped literally reliving all the awful things I did to people and the fact my life consists of the same shit everyday right now is a product of that. A product of me. Even though I don’t want to hurt people, yet I do time and time again, all of my life has consisted of losing people who mean a lot to me and realise they are better off. I’ve never had many friends or people I felt connected to, always felt in a way isolated and it’s not that crazy that when I meet someone I love that I expect too much from them, I become clingy and pushy, I am extremely selfish, I’m a horrible person by nature. 

Why am I such an unlikeable person? Why do I do any of the things I do? Why do I hurt people that I care so much about, drive them away? Why do I do this to myself so much every single fucking time, this is my fault and only mine so why do I do this? Why can’t I just have a life where I’m happy and I have the people who make me happy in it? I’m a fucking loser and I’m sick of being that and doing the things I do. I hate me, I hate my life, and I just don’t want to do this anymore. Months later and I’m still as fucked up from it all, still in as much pain, still hurt so fucking deeply by myself. My entire life has been me hating myself, felt I never fitted in anywhere had no identity and lost those that I cared so much about because of my actions. I don’t deserve the people I had in my life, the place I am is where I’m meant to be, mentally, socially, physically it’s all I’ve ever been and will be, and it stops now.

So many people have left my life and been better off, while every time I’m left facing me and the reality of it all, I don’t have anything worth it. Nothing I do gives me purpose, and anything that does make me happy I ruin. I feel so empty so pointless, literally nothing makes me happy or matters to me, and it’s so bad because it should, I should care and be happy but I’m not, I have a car, one year off a degree, stable job and money but that’s never mattered to me, I’ve never taken the opportunities to make a friend group, I wake up everyday to no texts or messages from anyone because I’m not a fun person to have in someone’s life, other people are. I get told over and over that I need to learn to be alone, but I’ve been alone my entire life I don’t do things that people my age should be doing or things I want to do because having people to do them with is what makes them special and matter. I’m sick of being alone. literally my entire life has been me being my only real friend, and anyone who does come in to my life I push away or isolate myself from them because I know I’ll eventually hurt them. Any social interaction I’m invited to or I’m part of I act like a controlling manipulative weirdo and want to make it all about me, no one wants me in their life and it’s not that hard to see why, I’m not someone is fun to be around or have in life. Im an embarrassment to people and I’m an embarrassment to myself, I wake up every day alone to do the same stuff over and over again, just trying to get to the next day, why would anyone want that? 

Everyday I want to die because this is not the person I ever wanted to be, or how I ever wanted to treat people, but it’s the reality of it. I’ve always had the idea to move country and get away, start my life again, but I’ve done that in certain aspects and I’ve fucked it up time and time again, the same stuff keeps happening, because the issue isn’t other people, it’s me. When people come in to my life they wonder why I do the certain things I do why my social media is so sparse, why I’m not out with people as much why I don’t have many friends, why I spend so much time on places like Reddit and I’m focused so much on self help, it’s because Its an escape to the reality of my life, about not wanting to be me and realising that there really aren’t many people in my life that see me as important to them or would consider me a good friend. It’s always been like that, I’ve always felt different from the rest and always been alone, it’s probably a big reason why I cling so much on to relationships because without that, I have virtually no social interaction and losing that person is literally losing everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m alone in life because I’m not good to have in others life’s, that’s been made clear to me time and time again. When I hurt someone like I have to people I’ve been lucky enough to love, I just choose to remove myself from their life at this point because it’s clear they’d be so much better off, forgetting ever meeting me, I’m a negative thing in their life and I can’t blame them for thinking that, it’s been that way my entire life, being someone that hinders people’s life’s, not benefits them. It’s why I have nothing. Im a hurdle to a happier life for them. I always was left feeling wonder why I never experienced anything with family when people spend so much time with their parents and get along with them, doing so much with friends being able to socialise and just be wanted by others, I’ve never had that and don’t think I ever will, I’m not deserving of it ive had chances to get that life I always wanted but being 25 and seeing where I am and how the same patterns continue and continue, it’s not worth the amount of serious therapy, medication everything to potentially be better, it won’t ever happen, I’m scared of being 30 35 40 or older and still having the same problems over and over, that’s not a life I Want to live, it’s never been. 

Should anyone go through life trying their hardest to not be the person they are? Is that a way to live? Waking up everyday trying to not be you? That’s been me my entire life, imagining, dreaming and sometimes praying to be someone different to be a person who has a life worth living, something about myself to make me care for the life I live with people who make me happy and who I can experience so much with. I’m tired of all of this pain and loneliness, it’s constantly realising I’m never gonna live that life I wanted and be with the people I do, because I’ll just hurt and hurt over and over again. I’m not happy being me and can’t imagine I ever will be, I live each day thinking about my past and the happiness I had and how I find ways each time to destroy it and that’s an issue with me as a person. I wish that things were different and my life wasn’t a continued feeling of regret and hate for myself but it’s not. I hate everything I’ve done, the way I let myself be and I just can’t keep waking up with the overbearing shame of it all. No matter how hard I try, the amount of effort, emotionally and mentally to be a better person, the person I want to be, it never changes. I repeat the same selfish, manipulative patters every time, I leave those who I care so much about freaked out and scared by my actions and who could blame them? I literally push the people I love to be scared of me, their families not wanting them to be involved with me anymore their friends thinking they’d be be better off without me, and where does that leave me? Facing the reality of my actions of the person I am of the person I let myself be time and time again, I’m a monster a fucking freak and someone no one should have the misfortune of having in their life. 

They deserve better, so much better, and I absolutely do not. I put myself in these situations I create them, I give myself the false hope that I can be happy, have someone in my life that does make me happy, someone I truly fucking care so much about but I always, always find some way to fuck it up, to ruin the thing that I love so much, and then I’m left thinking about this stuff day to day realising how much of an awful person I am, I never learned the first time it happened, the second or third so who’s to say I will now? I appreciate everyone who has tried to help me and support me through this hard time, you tried you’re absolute best but I’m too far gone, this was inevitable it always has been. 


The inclination of hope was the only thing I’ve had to keep going in the last years. That things could improve I could get that life I wanted, that I could have the people in it that matter the most. It’s been rightfully shot down time and time again even when I try to fix things, commit to being better I delude myself to think I’ll ever change. The reality is when I hear the tone of their voice when talking to me. The coldness of it, the lack of interest in me or having anything to do with me, and not just them everyone around them family and friends alike. They don’t want anything to do with someone like me, I had people that used to be excited to see me spend time with me and truly brought me so much happiness and I’ve pushed away like always because I can’t ever be the person they hoped I’d be, the person I hoped I’d be. They see me for what I truly am, a horrible, selfish and destructive person. They have every right to no longer want someone like me in their life and feel they would be better off if I wasn’t part of it. I deserve this all of this. It’s why I’m alone, why Im the person I am, the choices I make are my own and I live with those choices every single day. Everyone would be better off without me in their life that’s the only thing I’m sure about. I hate no one but myself so please don’t think or believe that any of this was directed outwards, I cared and still care so much about those that I hurt but my actions have always been telling of the person I am and the life I live. This isn’t a case of just pushing through this hard time because I’ve tried to distract myself, meeting people, watching tv, playing games, going out walks talking to my family and grandparents and everything you are supposed to do in hard times, but my life has been this constant feeling of being unwanted and lack of identity, I don’t know who I am or what matters to me, the only times I’ve ever felt truly myself and happy is when I am with those that I love and to have people that mean so much to me, and holding out hope that a person like that will once again appear in my life isn’t worth all this constant hate for myself. 

I mentally and physically just can’t do this anymore, hurting people I care about and put so much in to loving, and then have them leave my life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I never have and anytime I think things have gotten better I find a way to fall back to where I was but this time it’s so much worse, I genuinely believe there’s something defective with me as a person, I think I’m internally broken, I’m a crazy person who obsesses over being someone else. I hate the skin I am in. It hurts so much to care so much about someone, to try your hardest to be the best person you can be, and yet continue to fuck it all up, because you can’t change. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me, and going on living each day wishing I wasn’t me isn’t something I want to do anymore. I miss the feeling of having someone I care so much about in my life, that feeling of connection and love, it takes so much for me to feel that feeling of love and belief that someone loves me but every time, every fucking time I ruin it, I change their perception of me, I show them why I’m not someone they want in their life. Now I wake up everyday with constant thoughts each day are of the people I’ve hurt and lost due to my actions and just how fucking weird and horrible I am, I don’t want to keep doing that, I can’t justify it in anyway, I’m pathetic. I don’t see how anyone could ever love someone so fucked up. I can pin point the exact date the last time I laughed, genuinely smiled or felt any sense of happiness, it hurts me so much looking back to that day realising how short lived any happy moments in my life are and the only reason I lose that is because of me and my actions the decisions I make and which I’m responsible for. It breaks my heart, it hurts me so much and all I do day to day is relive it and feel it every moment. I hate everything about myself, I’m nothing but the fucking bane of my own existence and choices, I genuinely know and believe that I am worth nothing to no one and there is a part of me that at least feels some feeling of acceptance and gratitude that no one will ever deal with the shit I bring, the problems I have and the consistent hurt. I’m sorry to those who did, but now others will have a chance at happiness without people like me in their life. 


No one deserves to be treated the way I treated people. I sincerely hope they live a happy life, they absolutely deserve it, because even though it all ended through me being so horrible to them, they brought me happiness that meant the world to me, genuinely. This isn’t anyone’s fault but mine so please don’t feel guilty for it, no one can save me from myself or the things I do over and over again, so please don’t look for someone or something to blame, this was my decision, something I caused and created and this is the only thing I’ve felt sure about. I’m really sorry I wish I was a better, different person, but I’ll never be the person I want to be or how I want to be for others. These have been the loneliest, lowest, most self hating months of my entire life, I can’t keep running from the person I am and the things I do. I just can’t bare to see someone I care so much about leave my life again and decide they are better off because of the things I do, my life isn’t what I ever wanted it to be, and the way I treat people isn’t the way I ever wanted to treat them, but I always cross the line and lose the person who means more than anything to me. I’m a disgusting person and that’s all I ever have been, I assure you the world will be a better place without horribly toxic people like me in it. There is no going back now. There’s a part of me that genuinely believed these people I was blessed to have in my life were signs of fate, an angel in a sense, someone who has came in to my life to show me that I can have that life I always wanted and strived for, that connection, love and feeling of being wanted and cared about, I was so unbelievably happy with the snippet of the life I had with those that were so close to me and meant so much but I destroyed it, pushed them away and hearing the distance and disassotiation they have with me when realising just how awful I was for them how horrible I was and how I was nothing but a negative influence on them, even their friends and family mimic those feelings, because it is undeniable truth. 


Then the familiar feeling of me having to reflect on myself, to look at the person I am and the complete and utter emptiness that is my everyday life. I have no doubts that these people are better off without me in their life, absolutely no doubts, I believe and know everyone would live a happier and more fulfilling life without someone like me in it, it’s why I removed myself from social media and isolated myself in these last number of months. I can’t hurt anyone else I can’t go through this self hating pain and realisation of the person I am time and time again. The three who were so special and close to me will go on and make the world a better and brighter place, bringing happiness to their friends, family and those closest to them. They deserve utter happiness because they are amazing beautiful people with pure hearts and souls who I done nothing but hurt, but that won’t change the outcome of their life and the meaning they will bring for the rest of their life. Everyone is lucky to have people as incredible and special as them. I loved them with every inch of my heart and I’m sorry my actions didn’t reflect that and for the horrible experiences I brought, the tears I caused them. I never wanted to be that person or see those that mean the most to me in pain, but it’s what I do, consistently and unforgivably hurt those who don’t deserve anything but love and kindness. 


Everyday is the same, I’m hurting so so so much, close to tears everyday, feel worthless hopeless I’ve just given up on this, living on to feel this for a long time to not know when it will end and for when it will inevitably happen again. The same thoughts go through my head everyday no matter how much I want them to stop, I hate the person I am, the person I’ve let myself be to others and for the person I will be in the future. I can’t do this anymore I feel so alone and isolated, this isn’t living, this is just enduring pain and hate in the blind hope it will somehow maybe get better when I know it won’t, I’ve been through this too many times. I can’t keep waking up in this skin and life, the loneliness and calamity of everyday is nothing but just self hate, even when I’m around people I know see value in me I feel incredibly alone so I just isolate myself to save them from the inevitable. This is truly what I want and I have for a number of months now as well as periods in my life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I never have, why I do the things I do and destroy the things I love but  I can’t run from my past and I am bound to repeat the future because I’ve tried everything I can to be the person I wanted to be for me and those that mean the most. I can’t have someone I care so much about leave my life again because of the shit that I have brung on them for living a life I’m too pathetic to have. This is the end for me, I have no future only unavoidable pain that is completely, profoundly self inflicted. I’m sorry.",,Depressed
"The world is not designed for meSo, I'm ugly. I'm probably never going to find any love and die alone. I'm 20 years old and have never had a date. This has to do with the fact I'm unattractive. It's pretty noticeable what's wrong with me. Some people occasionally called me names when I was 12 but beyond that I never really got bullied.

Twice I got rejected. They said it had nothing to do with my appearance, which might be true, but definitely has played an extremely large factor in their decision to reject me.

I do have friends though. I asked a couple of them whether my 'condition' was noticeable and all of them said no. I know they only say no to make sure I'm not feeling terrible, but it makes me feel terrible because I know they lie.

Everyday I'm thinking about my condition. I'm so depressed about it I'm thinking about euthanasia. My friends don't know about this. They think I'm just living normal life, since I don't talk about this stuff with them.

I don't know how to behave around new people. I always have the feeling they think I'm weird or that something is wrong with me. 

I know I'm not the ugliest in the world but I'm definitely ugly. Comments like ""you're probably not that ugly"" are not helpful. Objectively spoken I'm just ugly. The world is not designed for ugly people. All they get is rejection, they are being bullied, they are considered less... All I feel is mental pain and I can't imagine a future where I'll be happy.

"My Boyfriends 18th Birthday presents. Hi everyone. 
My boyfriends birthday is in a few weeks. As of current I have bought him a leather phone case with his name engraved and limited edition hungry jacks cups he has missed out on. My plan was then to also get a self care basket with a couple colognes and a face wash and mens bath bombs because he has baths a lot.

I am overthinking a lot and worrying he might not like them which will suck. I found this smart watch which I thought might be good for work as he dosent have one but it still looks classy but not too classy. Should I get him the watch?

I also had the idea to get him a Lego set (the stormtrooper one) as he always jokes about me getting him lego and it's a display one so he would probably actually like it. 

I already know what he is getting me for my birthday which is a necklace to replace one I currently wear all the time. 

Ahhhhhh teenage boys please help me 😂 if someone is willing to help me over pm over the next few days while I decide what to get him, that would be great!!

One of my problems I have with myself is I am super self-conscious. So imagine how I felt when someone I thought was trying to talk me down from this just used it to flirt. 

Well here I am again SW. I wrote in a journal for two weeks talking about the different reasons why I'm killing myself. I'm finally going to go through with it today. I have a therapy appointment at 3pm and then afterwards I am driving to a lake, and jumping in with weights tied around my feet. I don't want to live anymore. I am a failure. Everyone in my life hates me. They would not care if I died. Especially my boyfriend. 


My boyfriend said to me yesterday, ""I love you but it is so clear we are not meant together"" and then said never mind. He keeps saying we are not meant to be together, and blames all of our problems on me. Because I am the complacent half of the relationship. I am the person everyone takes advantage of me. I am a piece of shit that only has a couple of hours left. 

I told my mom I wanted to hill myself and she said to me ""You keep saying you want to do that, but you haven't done anything yet. Don't be like the boy who cried wolf"" see? Even she doesn't care if I go.

WELL we learnt about circuits today in physics, and me being the absolute nerd that I am obviously got all the questions right whilst the rest of my class was sitting there scratching their heads (mind you, we are top set so tbh that was quite disappointing but whatever) and anyways eventually the teacher put a question on the board and asked us to write down the answer. I immediately told my friend the answer (coz I’m an arrogant bitch and my friends always laugh at me for knowing the answer before the teacher even finished the sentence) and so ppl around us were like wtf how did u get that. So I started explaining it to like basically half of the class (including the boy I like). Eventually the teacher was like “I heard a lot of discussion about the question, but a person that was particularly loud was Ron (me)” but that’s beside the point... the POINT is that after the lesson my friend (who sat next to the boy I like) told me that he was staring at me when I was talking, and I was like nahhh he was just looking at me coz I was explaining the question and she straight up went like *no, he was staring at you* (but like in a good way) so now I’m sad coz it gives me hope that he likes me even tho I know that he doesn’t...

I am 26, have no social interactions besides going to work and the gym. I have no friends, never had a girlfriend or any kind of physical contact to the opposite sex. The worst part is my work and all my failed projects. I just do not enjoy life. I know that many people here are in worse and more precarious situations, but I do not want to exist.

"One last cry for helphi,  I don't reach out much. I am 22 m. 

2 suicide attempts,  one by hanging from my attic ceiling 8 months ago,  the other by fentanyl OD 4 months ago.  each time someone found me,  because I wanted them to.  I wish they hadn't. 

I threw away my scholarships,  my degree,  my relationships,  all through drugs and driven by my sick mind. 

I've been in the ward twice,  through php,  countless therapists,  psychiatrists,  and meds. I am just so tired. 

Lately the longing for oblivion through suicide has outweighed the work it would take to repair myself.  So much god damn work...I feel I've wrung out my resources.  I took people's advice.  I got help. I even took my own advice but I've only gotten worse. 

There are some train tracks in my town that run on a strict schedule.  I have loud headphones.  I can't stop thinking about that. Suicide hotlines sometimes help me through to the next day,  but the next day is always the same, the sadness and pain I see never go away. 

I gave up drugs.  I gave up sex.  I gave up everything I thought was holding me down. I found music.  I thought I found myself.  Every day I lose it all over again.  I wanted to change the world but it's not looking like I will be able to.

"It should have been me. Years ago. It never got better, and only got much worseTo say that it's been a life is a gross understatement. At 39 I've had a life that most find unbelievable until others from the past come around and confirm. 

I have more scars than smiles and with moments of true and great happiness, have come long unforgettable periods of grinding back to being just ""ok"". Those who I consider close can go months without hearing from me and the family I cant choose haven't ever been there at all. If I had the bravery, I'd been able to off myself and it would be months before anyone would know. 

My mother would probably launch the first lawsuit to get at my life insurance. Despite not speaking to her for the past seven years, taking years to meet my kids and not visiting me when I died. But she deserves it, right? Even if it takes from kids. 


All that and I can say I've caused more harm and unhappiness than anything else in my existence. My poor kids have nothing to say about their father and their mothers I'm sure can say the same. 

My health has been a steady decline. Years of therapy, and tests I'm diagnosed CFS/Narcoleptic. As a heavy machine operator it put an end to that. Begging my work for a position that would work has proven fruitless. Trying to find other work has been a failure. I have a business diploma and a pile of certificates that do nothing either. 

I spent a life playing drums for various bands. Thirteen albums, numerous album contribution credits, and when my cognitive when to shit, my music was no longer something to turn to. Still isn't anything I can do. There's no place in a band for a drummer who gets lost in songs after a few minutes. 

Got married. For a time there, I couldn't have imagined to be happier. But when my health started to fall, and her debt was paid off I was told that I had two weeks to find a new place to live. Essentially I was fired. when I was told this I was still very much in love with her and despite being placed on disability I was working three under the table jobs to pay and was still told I wasn't making enough. I was told that she wanted to work it out and I found a place close to her. I haven't seen her or my former step son in months. My daughter's we very hurt by this and all I can think about is how I managed to fuck everyone up in that. 

Spent fifteen years from starting to current times working on a promotional company for live music. I've raised several thousand in charitable contributions, and helped launch a music community. On more than one occasion, I'd be speaking with those I call friends, only to find out that I've been mistaken for someone else. And when. My name has come up in conversation, and I've been asked when he's going to show up. 

I'm a lousy human being trying to be a good human. Through my teens into through most of my twenties. Some call it antifa, I was anti facist. Violently opposed to racists and homophobes. Always protesting and standing against the class separation and the breaking of the working class. Later in life, I carry horrible memories of what I've done to what I once considered horrible people. Some sights and sounds never go away. No matter how right you may think you are. 

This is my paraphrased thought process lacking the depression, anxiety, and disassociative disorder. It doesn't include the beatings of my dad, negligence and abuse of my mother. The absence of family altogether. Poor relationship choices, and being a poor relationship choice. Lost and long forgotten attempts at being a good person, but always asked to do more. 

The present day I watched some of the finer people take their own lives. Everyone, taking a piece of me with them. Leaving behind families and friends. Some had it hard, while others had it easy. While it is not for me to judge, I woke up this morning feeling that I deserve this. 

I've earned it.

There is no ""it gets better"" or ""you just have to try harder"". One can try as hard as they want, constantly saying that is gets better. Or that it can be worse. I've been worse, seen worse and if anyone dares ay that I need to try harder, hasn't eaten from a trash can for their elementary school lunch, or taken drugs to curb an appetite so they wouldn't eat anything, ensuring that there was good for their kids when they visit. 

I've done enough. I've had enough. I tried. At what time do I get to say that I'm ready to finally stop hurting. I don't lie. I've lived to be as accountable as I can be. I'm worth money dead. Enough to ensure my kids get college paid, and have a good life for both of them and their mothers. There is no regret in saying that dead I'll take better care of my kids than alive. 

Some say the truth hurts. Knowing what I do, the truth doesn't hurt. The truth is silent, and very comforting to me. And having the choice, I hope that one day, I won't have to wake up. At all.",,Depressed

"You know how I knowThat my life is worthless and no longer worth living? 
One, I absolutely loved cooking and baking my entire life. The last year has completely taken that away from me. I don't have the money for a place to live let alone food.
I have no desire to lift a finger to cook anything anymore. I used to feel great preparing my kids delicious and really healthy meals every single day, every single meal. Right now, I don't remember the last time they had something I wouldn't normally consider crap.
All I think about is killing myself. I have completely detached from my children who I used to love so much. Now I look at them and I don't feel anything. I still want what is best for them, but I just don't feel anything. 
Having worked my whole life for everything I had and asking my friend to store it for me until I found a place turned out to be a mistake. He ruined everything in less than a month. Literally everything I owned is now trash you see out at most garage sales. Now, if I ever do find another place I have to start completely over. Shit that took me 15 years to get is going to take another 15 years of my life to build up.
I have not been patient with my kids. Homelessness is destroying who I was. I feel sorry for them but no matter how hard I try I can't treat them right anymore. I want to die for their sake. I don't want to affect their mental health for their entire lives because of this. 
All I want is a place to live. Is working two jobs not enough? When did literally killing yourself working become not good enough to have a home? I guess I'll never be good enough. I can't do this any more. I am literally killing myself trying to get somewhere and am getting no where at all. Everyday seems to just get worse.

"My mother found me after I overdosed and left me thereI'm a 19 year old former uni student. I dropped out of studying for a degree in manufactured engineering just before christmas. I moved out of the city I'd lived in these past 4 years and moved back in with my mother.

We argued a lot, or to be more accurate I'd piss her off by not realising x thing needed doing (because she wouldn't say anything, just silently fume) and she'd yell at me. Tell me I'm disgusting, lazy, not mentally ill, dirty, vile. She told me, a borderline personality sufferer, that I'm a manipulator. That I use people... that I'm a train of self destruction that hurts everyone in my life and leaves them.

She's been this way all my life, and started saying this stuff to me when I was around 10. I finally realise that she doesn't actually believe these statements, rather she remembers things I've mentioned. She knows I'm scared of becoming a user and she decides to hurl it at me because she *knows* it'll hurt me. She says statements knowing that it'll hurt, and when I cry she raises her voice, then yells about me acting like a baby by crying. She takes enjoyment out of belittling me when she's hurt by something that I've accidentally done. 

So christmas eve I took a overdose of dihydrocodeine and amitriptyline. I took about 15 pills each. I began to fall asleep whilst eating pizza in the evening. My mother kept shouting me and asking me ""how can you sleep sitting up?"". I could still respond at this point but in a slurred way, saying I was just very tired.

I went to bed. My mother promised me that she would wake me in 20 minutes, so it'd be a nap as it was only 6pm ish. My last memory is sitting on my bed as she promised me she'd wake me.

I woke at 3am with no memory of what I'd done, hallucinating. Every time I'd close my eyes I'd see something, and when I opened them I'd see even more disturbing things. I have hallucinations due to BPD so it didn't disturb me too much.

I woke my mother up around 11am christmas day with a coffee. Later in the day I began remembering what had happened, my overdose and asked her if she tried to wake me. She looked at me and said ""I tried, you wouldn't wake up. I shook and pulled you and you carried on asleep. So you overdosed?"". I admitted it. She just nodded. She didn't look upset or angry or even empty or defeated, just mildly annoyed. I asked her why she didn't phone an ambulance. She just said I was still breathing.

My life has gone into shambles. I sleep on my mothers fold up bed in the hallway of her one bedroom flat. I have no friends, no purpose, nothing. I live with a soul destroying mental illnesses which leaves me on the verge of abusing people regularly, and in an effort to not hurt people I hurt myself through cutting and burning and using drugs and alcohol, and have done for nearly 10 years.

I am heavily scarred, most are keloid. Red and purple and silver keloid scarring, raised and dents in my skin, all over from my arms to my breasts to my legs. I pissed myself the other month because the prescription painkillers, the constant use for years have done something to my bladder. I suffer with stomach pains due to the amount of pills I regularly take. I have no job, and considering the fact I can't even talk to people without stuttering and struggle to do basic things like go to the supermarket or talk  to strangers it's no easy feat to get a job. Still I had a volunteer job at my old city, but I live too far away now.

I'm broken, finally broken, and my own mother left me knowing I could die, because only a stupid person can walk on somebody unconscious and unable to wake and decide that theres zero chance that person will die.

"Today, I have made the decision to quit vaping. I hope this can be an inspiration for you too. I used to have a mindset that the people who did drugs, smoked, or vaped in their youth were terrible kids and didn't do anything good for themselves. I changed my perspective after I ended up doing it myself.   


I began vaping when a girl that liked me invited me to her family's house. It was in terrible condition, but her family seemed sweet. They were pretty rough around the edges, and kept a massive pack of Monster Energy and beer in their refrigerator if that says something. She offered her vape to me after she took a hit, and I thought I'd impress her by doing it too. After that, I had a huge head rush, gave it back to her, and something inside my head just flipped like a switch. Some kind of euphoria that I had never felt before that I wanted more of.   


Every time I went and saw her, all I could think about was hitting her vape again. I knew I couldn't get one myself, so I would use her as my vantage point. Months later when school started, we stopped getting together to hang out, and I lost the chance to vape for a long time. I wanted to keep feeling the way I did when I first tried it.  


Just recently, I hit the vape of one of my acquaintance friends from temptation. They had a mod, making it very heavy when hitting it. I got hooked again and started looking around to see if anyone sold vapes or were in the loop of people who did. I made friends with a dealer who sold THC and nicotine.   


I got my own puff bar.   


Ever since that day I had a massive esteem boost. I felt like the cool kid on the block. The person that everyone wanted to hang out with because they got their hands on something that most people can't because they know people. I felt powerful, I felt euphoric from having it in my possession.   


Then, things began to spiral. I started getting cravings throughout the day and I'd have to go to the bathroom to take breaks. I then knew that I couldn't do it anymore, and that it would soon become a problem if I kept doing it. But something physically made me continue to use my puff bar. I would tell myself no mentally, and just keep hitting it anyway, even if I felt sick to my stomach. Over, and over, and over. To the point where I would get separation anxiety if It wasn't constantly in my pocket or in my hand.   


I knew I was physically addicted to nicotine at that point, and something needed to change.   


I knew it would be hard for me to quit, and it was entirely my fault. I got myself into this mess, now I need to get myself out of it. The first thing I did was think about why I wanted to do it. I came with the reason for it being the amount of trust and generosity my parents have given me. I have just recently passed my driver permit test on my first try, got a debit card with a checking account opened up, held all A's in school, and gotten my first job with a raise of 50 cents before I even started working! That's when It came to me that I have a good life, and things are going very well for me. My relationships with my friends are amazing, my family is supportive of me and what I do for myself, and I respect myself as a person. If all of these good things are happening to me, why am I continuing to vape? Shouldn't I be one of the lowlife kids that I thought people were if they did those things?   


Just an hour ago, I threw out the puff bar, and vowed to myself never to do this again. I can't let the things that are happening to me now or in the future change because I have an addiction I can't control.   


Please let this be a lesson to anyone going through a similar situation as me. I'm not saying you need to quit smoking or vaping, all I want you to know is that you should be safe no matter what. If this is something that you can handle, be my guest. But to those who can't hold on to the responsibility like me, don't do it. It isn't worth the instant gratification for your five seconds of fame, and the depression that follows.   


If you have any questions, I'd be free to take and answer. Thank you to anyone who reads this.   


TL;DR - I started vaping, realized how wrong it would be to continue to, and made the obligation to quit. I hope I'm an inspiration to anyone else in a similar situation.",,Anxious

Innovative Approach To Treating Depression In Men

Listen to my podcast preview here:

Part 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puo9VVUOPUk

Part 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-UITvrXB0g

This podcast's mission is to fight the stigma and help any young man who's struggling with depression.
I have 
Men: We need to be decisive, confident, persistent and ambitious to fight depression. We need to embrace these character traits in order to open up, talk about mental illness and achieve what we want in life. 
​ 
There has been a shift in western society over the last 10 years towards political correctness, feminism and the supression of masculinity.
​
The media has been feeding young men misinformation by promoting nice guy values. They are causing men to grow up weak and insecure and women unsatisfied.

It is no surprise that rates of depression and anxiety are skyrocketing, 20% of men date 80% of women and approximately 50% of marriages end in divorce.

Men find success through decisiveness, confidence, persistence and ambition.
​
Men are leaders who engage the world with their shoulders back and their head held high.

Men don’t believe in luck they believe in cause and effect.

We need to lead with decisiveness, confidence, persistence and ambition.

Alpha Therapy will always encourage young men to take action and change their life to no longer feel powerless over depression.",,Anxious

"I came out as Bisexual to my girlfriend and it went better than expected Okay so obligatory this happened a few months ago, was in late February. Secondly, I struggle with anxiety, depression and self esteem issues on a regular

I realised I was bi was sat on a wall crabbing with my older sister just talking about sex and relationships, we have quite an open relationship so this wasn’t an awkward topic to discuss. It clicked in my mind after god knows how long that I was bi and there was no way around it. This was in July of last year.

I ended up coming out to one of my closest friends because the thought of telling my girlfriend petrified me. I knew I’d have to do it at some point and sooner rather than later would be best. I got myself really worked up over it, so worked up that I ended up having a string of nightmares across a 3 week time period of my girlfriend leaving me. Nearly every night I would wake up crying and shaking from just fear and anxiety and the thought of losing her because of my sexuality. 

Acting on the advice of my best friend and a few others I slowly started to drop hints to my girlfriend. Over the course of the next probably 4 months I would hint at it, still getting the occasional nightmare and break down but better progress towards ultimately coming out. 

As part of my 17th birthday my sister had bought us some Cage The Elephant tickets for late February as they were my favourite band and I had never been to a proper concert before. We went, it was an absolutely amazing night even if my anxiety did cause a little mishap at one point. Okay now onto the juicy bit I guess? 

I met up with my girlfriend on the Saturday following the concert, we did our usual cuddle and chat on her bed and watched a bit of Netflix. Then she asked how the concert was and I explained how it was fantastic and amazing and I wish she could’ve been there because there was so much energy and passion in the audience. She asked how the warm up acts were (they were both good) and I managed to tell her that I thought one of the guys was cute and that if I could’ve I probably would’ve had sex with them given the chance. She looked a little concerned and being anxious this sent waves of “Oh I’ve messed up, the nightmares are gonna come true”. Then kissed me then said “You better not do a Philip Schofield on me” with a smile and a giggle and I, well I was on the brink of tears at that point. We cuddled for the rest of the day.

She had been picking up on the hints, all that time, and I’m guessing had figured out that I wanted to tell her but was just too scared. I love that girl so much, she means the world to me and I’m so glad she’s so supportive of me. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without her. 

So yea, that’s how I came out to my girlfriend (of 3 years, in fact this was right before our 3rd anniversary; like a week before)",,Anxious

My family has helped me out before, they were incredibly kind and understanding, but made it known that it can’t happen again. That was around 2 years ago. Since then I’ve built up a lonely web of lies, about why I’m skint, why I go out, all sorts of things. 

I don’t know why I can’t stop myself. I feel faulty.

I’ve managed to get a job that will remove my ability to gamble from Mid October to January. I can’t gamble online. I have a way out of this hell for at least that period.

But I need to find £350 by the first of October. At this point, I’ve got nothing left to sell, nobody left to ask, and I am completely on my own. 
I am going to a GA meeting for the first time on Thursday, which is the same time I plan on telling my closest friend who I know will be understanding and I am not afraid of letting her down as it’s an unconditional friendship. 

I won’t harm myself. Mostly because I’ve tried before and I’ve seen first hand how it broke the people I love down. If I can’t live for me then I’m determined to live for them.
But the thoughts won’t go away. It feels like it’s always an option, even though I know better. 

I know that things can get better and I know that I can change. I really want to. But I can’t get over how much I hate myself. I’ve phoned help lines and spoken to doctors. 

I’m so sorry that this is so depressing. I’m scared of myself and my lack of impulse control. 
I just need someone to tell me that things will be okay. If anyone has ever been in this situation and come out the other end - please let me know. Talking to my family is not an option.",,Depressed

"A depressing thing I wrote once Following pain

I'm falling and falling just to feel part of my own painful story because there is no one left to tell it. I tred lightly on my tears of which the origin is buried in conflict and the paradoxical nature of things. My freedom is but a dream I have no luxury to own if I want my thoughts to be true and excepted. Fear is a fight between the want and hate of pain that comes with self doubt that I have held my self to in the back and core of my head. I am simply a tool for others to use as the fight for ownership gives rust. Words are vessels that carry power through the pain, if only to fix the path of dismay they leave behind. I am pessimist, I am harsh, I am ruthless, I am one with the crowd. I am optimistic, I am kind, I am gentle, I am left behind to clean the mess I was convinced I made based off my chosen opinions that give no meaning but rather fictional hope of redemption. Life is pure in its problems and blunt in its solution. Life is a truth told by a lier. Life is a path paved by death and followed by the idea of light.",,Anxious

"Goodbyes.To Reddit, I'll do it. Am I scared? Of course. Will it be worth it? I don't know. I am so tired. None of you will give a shit. It will make no difference to you. Thanks to those who once helped, and fuck you to those who just told me to just takes some fucking meds already.

To my abuser, you ruined my life. I hate you and I hate myself because of what you did to me. 

To G, I know why you did it now. I get it. I understand. I don't blame you for it because I will be taking the same actions as you now. I know what it did to people. It hurt me and your family and friends, but I know now that you are in peace. And soon I will be peaceful too.

To my lover, I love you so much and I am so sorry for what my death will put you through. But I hope you can forgive me and realize that I am not in pain any more. I can't keep bringing you down. It isn't fair to you. You deserve better. 

To my parents, I am so sorry. It will be hard to lose a child. Know that I love you and I am in peace. I am where I want. To my sister, I am sorry we didn't get the chance to have a relationship. I wish things would have gone differently, but they are what they are. Know that I still love you.

To society, fuck you. I hate you. I hate those of you who used me, trampled on me, and maliciously hurt me with the intention to cause harm. I know what you really are. In fact, I have spent 4 years studying you! Know that I know what society is truly like, I hate it. I don't want to be a part of it. You are so judgemental, selfish, unforgiving, and sexist. I hate you.

To myself, I am sorry. But I hate what you have become. It should have gone differently. It's not fair what you went through. You were unlucky. I wish you could have gotten better, but you didn't. I hurt because you are in so much pain. It has driven you to insanity. You hate yourself. You did this. You dug your grave, no it is time to lie in it.

Goodbye everyone.

"I want a way out of lonelinessEvery day I wake up, I have to put on a smile to pretend everything is ok, when in fact I cry alone in bed every night. I don't even know if I have any mental illness, I'm too afraid to see a shrink or a counselor, I'm afraid that if I get diagnosed with mental illness, my friends and family will alienate me, and truly making me an outsider. My friends and I used to be close, but now every one of them has their own social circle, and it's like I'm the third wheel to anyone of them, like I'm a burden to their social life. As for my family, my parents are quite conservative, they think mental illness is like a punishment, a karma to the person. That's why I'm too afraid to seek therapy or help, once they noticed, they'd probably be ashamed of who I am. And right now I'm already pretty isolated, my friends and I rarely hangout these days, I have very few social interaction at school, so I can't imagine what'll happen if I lose my connection with my family. 

It seems like I only have two options left. Either I end myself this week or I have to keep hiding and prolong my pain until the day I can't take it and kill myself. I know my experience is nothing special and maybe a lot of you have similar feelings before. All I wanted to say is that if you find the strength to carry on, I wish you the best of luck, you are brave and courageous unlike me.

"Problem with Science I just realized half of science is actually mistake of previous scientists and their misconceptions still being taught to us.
Like we are taught that atoms of same elements are alike but that was a misconception of scientists before they found isotopes.
Then some guy said that current flows from higher potential to lower potential, which is even more serious of a lie as it is never told clearly to students. They are told like electrons flow from (-) to (+) but for convention we treat as if current flows from (+) to (-). But if you think about it current is flow of charges and charges are clearly flowing in the opposite way.
Then Newtons Gravitational law, it was wrong or maybe incomplete whichever you say.

Bio is an exception tho, 

But then there's a more dangerous thing, the names. Like how high were you to name things like that? Couldn't you just name them in English? Why Latin, just why?
Gain of electron is called Reduction! Seriously? 
And many more examples which I cant remember atm.
And Bio names, what were you guys naming? A monster ?

"Just a shell not aliveI am struggling to stay alive.  Even writing here is exhausting.  I feel numb or in emotional agony all of the time. There is this emptiness inside me that nothing seems to fill.  I look at people and feel apart from them.  I am going through the motions of life but I'm really dead. The only thing that goes around my head is the thought of terminating my life.  It's just a shell really.  I have a plan worked out and have warned the people closest to me. I have tried 7 times before so I know what I need to do. I have sought medical attention.  The doctor is referring me to a psychiatrist and I am on a waiting list for another service.  But I've had 7 years of intensive therapy since a breakdown in 2010.  I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder then as well.  Treatment hasn't made a significant difference to my mental health.  All I have realised is how traumatic my childhood was and how significantly it has damaged me.  My life now is ok.  My husband loves me very much.  I have a 12 year old daughter.  I have a very strong network of support;  people who really care about me.  But no matter what  they say, I feel unworthy of anyone's love or respect.  For a long time I have viewed myself as the disgusting blob of human flesh who is a burden on society.  I can't work.  Most days getting the washing done is a major achievement.  I sleep at least 15 hours a day.  I find it difficult to function sometimes.  Apparently sleep is my way of disassociating from the world.  I just can't face life anymore.  I have cut my social circle down to the people I can not avoid.  Friends are completely shut out.  The only thing that is forcing me to stay alive is my daughter.  She has suffered separation anxiety ever since she saw the police and paramedics escort me away during my breakdown in 2010.  She has ADHD and goes to counselling for it.  She told her counsellor that she often checks my pulse when I am asleep.  Her main concern is that I might die.  My god what am I doing to this child?  I don't know what to do.  I have tried so many things.  I don't want to destroy her, but I don't know how I am supposed to get better.  I have no control over my brain.  I think one day very soon I may take my life, not deliberately but as a means to get away from the agonising emotional pain I am in.  ",,Depressed

"I'm tired of living. (couldn't think of a proper title)Okay. I'm at the end of my rope. I decided I should post here and whine about my life before doing anything permanent.
I'm depressed and tired of life, and I'm contemplating suicide, as you might say. I've been to 3 psychiatrists in the last 1,5 years. None of them helped, but one tried to sell me homeopathic shit. So you can check ""professional help"" off the list. 

I have been homeschooled for 4 years (from grades 5 to 9), and I haven't done jack shit during that time. Basically, I skipped 4 years of school. So I have the educational level of a fifth grader. I went back to school last year, but I only lasted for 4 and a half months before bailing out again due to the workload and bullying. I don't know what to do, it seems hopeless. I have to go back to school tomorrow after a 3 month school break. (Not that I attended school before that) I can't stand seeing my classmates again, I despise most of them. My hands shake when I think about school and all the assignments, considering I'm a dumb fuck who can't even do basic maths and write a simple essay. I feel helpless. I live in a small house with my 2 little sisters and an overprotective mother, and I don't get any privacy, at all. I feel it (privacy) is very important to my well-being. I've tried talking to my mom about this but nothing came out of it. 
As for my sisters, I feel bad for them, they do nothing but watch TV all day and my mother just doesn't give a fuck. (not that she's busy, she doesn't have a job, I don't know what the fuck she does all day) It all just feels so sad and pointless. 
I don't have any interests either. I spend all my time on the computer, and I don't do anything cool like writing music or programming or anything, I just browse the internet pointlessly. My vision has dropped a lot because of that (at least I think so, I don't really know). Also, I sleep a lot (but I still feel tired in the end) and it is coincidentally the only part of my life that I enjoy. I read a lot of self-motivation articles and the such, I have tried a lot of stuff, but nothing I did seemed to help. 

So there. All that petty bullshit makes me feel the way I do. I don't know what to do about it. I'm tired and apathetic all the time. I don't have any reasons left to live. I'm not looking for attention or someone to talk to. Typing this out didn't make me feel any better either, but I guess it had to be done in order for you to understand my situation. There's a bunch of other stuff I could whine about, but I don't think it's important to the story.

"Not Urgently Close, But Need Wisdom/To VentI've had a major mental shift the past few days that's brought me away from the brink, but I spend a lot of time thinking about past mistakes and holding onto pain, and I feel like I'm talking to my loved ones about it too much, not respecting their space or being able to resume normal relationships with them. So I'd just like to vent here and welcome any thoughts on my situation, if anybody cares enough to read a massive ramble.

I'm a 24M with a history of suicidal tendencies, mostly from taking mistakes and major life changes way too hard and never letting go of them and moving on. Recently, my girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me. She had her reasons, and we talked through things, but she was vague about whether she wanted to break up for good, or just during the current semester so she could focus on her schoolwork and adjust her life a little. 

We were in a poly relationship with another couple who were very close friends. We had been romantically involved with them for about 2 years now, and when we broke up, the group thing got confusing. The other couple is married, so their relationship wasn't affected, but my ex and I each remained close to them, and everyone's feelings are still being sorted out. For now, my remaining girlfriend, the wife, and my boyfriend, the husband, remain romantically inclined towards me, but a little more distant and sort of....recovering. I haven't had any sort of sexual contact with either of them for quite so time, for other reasons that I'll go into later. But I do go over to their place a couple times a week, cuddle and kiss and hang out and we all remind each other how much we love each other.

I feel that my current mental state is burdening them, pushing them away. As I said, I've been much healthier this past week, but I had been having breakdowns almost daily, and I was constantly coming to them to talk about my latest thoughts and feelings. I feel that I'm not able to give the relationship time to heal, and I'm constantly afraid that it will fall apart or fade away because I couldn't relax and give up my desperation to see them all the time. It's not made any better by my near obsessiveness with hearing from them; I have very little schoolwork and my job only gives me 9 hours on the weekends. I have a lot of free time to sit around and wish they could talk to me, but they work extremely hard at a lot of things.

My girlfriend has her own problems. She's struggled with depression and anxiety for years, and has never had a significant sex drive. This has always worked well for the group, since I also have a low sex drive, while my ex and boyfriend fuck like rabbits. However, I do have a very strong emotional need for sex, and lately she has been on meds that completely inhibit her libido. Her husband is in a rough spot, because my ex has been pretty distant to him, and for me it adds another layer of worry about the relationship. How can I tell whether our lack of sex is from the meds or from our relationship being ""downgraded""? What if she simply doesn't feel that way about me any more? I don't need to have sex with her, I could be perfectly happy the rest of my life being romantically close and celibate; but I'm scared of the symbolism, of the inability to decipher where our relationship is and whether it's healing.

Well, a couple weekends ago, my depression and emotional instability kicked in on overdrive and I was lucky to wake up the next morning. I was texting my ex; we had stayed in casual contact, and while at work I inquired about her day, she mentioned a scholarship, I asked how that was going, etc. She stopped answering my questions, I went back to work. Several hours later I was home, watching tv and having my nightly drink, and asked if she'd missed my last couple texts. No answer. I asked if she was ok. No answer. I asked if she was ignoring me or angry at me. No answer. I told her I was getting very worried. She responded, saying essentially that ""we were broken up now, she didn't have to answer me if she didn't want to"". My pent up hurt at being ignored, fear that something had happened to her, emotional issues from the break up, and several stronger emotions held back for years of the relationship, all came out at once. I exploded. Called her a huge dick. Told her that ignoring me was hurtful and that a decent human being would at least take two seconds to tyoe out ""I'm busy"" or ""I can't talk right now"" or let someone know they were safe when asked. Texting all of this to her fed my anger, and also made me have even more dangerous emotions: instant guilt and fear, anguish, regret. I started texting apologies and tried to call her. My girlfriend, who had apparently been sitting on the couch with the two of them when my ex had suddenly burtlst into tears, sent me a very angry text telling me I was abusive and threatening to end our friendship. She would not respond to me either. I finally got in touch with my boyfriend. He was stern, serious, dark, and unforgiving. He told me that none of them would be sympathetic to my pain. That neither of the girls would talk to me. That there was no way to fix this and I deserved to feel awful. He told me that it was fine to feel hurt when ignored, but the amount that I felt hurt by it was ""invalid"", not normal, not reasonable. During our phone conversation, I started drinking my whiskey pretty agressively. We talked until about 3:30am, and he expressed concern for me while maintaining his original tone. I called another friend, mostly drunk at this point, and talked until I had to throw up around 5am or something. I tried to express how much pain I felt to my boyfriend, how I couldn't get past any mistake, and knowing that I'd hurt the three people I love most was too much to bear. But I eventually passed out, and he came by the mext morning. 

He climbed into my bed with me and cuddled me for a while. We talked about a lot of things. He told me that it wasn't as bad as I seemed to think, that he was glad I was still alive, that all three of them still loved me. We talked about all of the relationships. We had talked before about how my ex had been emotionally abusive to me, and how there had been a double standard in how everyone treated me. I said that last night felt like the intense eye-opening extreme of that. I asked how often he had seen my ex abuse me, from 1 to 10. He said about 7. I asked how many of those times were as bad or worse than what I did the night before. He said most of them. I asked how many times they had reacted to her that way; had his wife ever threatened to stop being her friend? Had he ever talked to her the way he talked to me? Had everyone ever stopped talking to her? He said no. I told him that I felt singled out, held to an impossible standard, and I felt like the pain she had caused me by ignoring me was completely discounted or considered worthless. Well, our moral debate on whether it's ok to ignore someone even if it causes them emotional pain continued for several days, but my underlying point, my feeling of being treated unfairly, he agreed with. None of this made me feel any better about what I had done; I knew I had been very, very wrong, I knew I had caused pain, and I knew that nothing justified it and nothing would erase it. The amount of hurt I feel knowing that I hurt the people I love is awful, unlike anything I've ever felt. I've had intractable nerve pain that high doses of Vicodin didn't even touch, and I would take that back in a second to undo this.

I fear that it changed their feelings towards me in ways that will never heal. I went to their place the night after the incident, expecting anger and coldness and being told off. Instead I got hugs and reassurances and therapy. Forgiveness and wisdom and love. But I still feel scarred. I still feel like the relationships are scarred. I feel like my girlfriend is still angry, still disappointed, still scared I might hurt her again. I feel like she loves me less because of what I did, and that she'll never feel the same about me again. My boyfriend acts much more normal towards me, but I still worry that I don't deserve his love or respect anymore.  I haven't spoke to my ex since then. I want to apologize, in person, but I worry that it's too soon or even that she will just never want to talk to me again. 

Most of the day I feel normal again, I can forgive myself and go about my routine and thinking about my partners makes me smile. I text them a couple times a day, saying good morning and maybe flirting a little, and they tend to not answer because they are very busy. I ask if I can come over a lot, I know they'll be busy most nights but I ask just in case. I worry that I'm pushing too hard, and they aren't quite ready for so much attention yet. I worry that they aren't back to where we were before yet, and I don't know if or when we will be. But then when I go over, we're all very physical and emotional and intimate and I feel much more secure.

One thing I worry about is becoming a better partner. What I want from our relationship, eventually, is to be a very important part of their lives. I want to be supportive, and helpful, and make them happy. I feel like I'm not good at any of those things, except that I like to do chores for them when I'm there. I never know what to say to make them happy, and they don't come to me to talk or open up when I try to offer a shoulder. They don't invite me over, and my girlfriend doesn't initiate (or usually respond to) conversations. She's busier than anybody I know, and very introverted, so I don't blame her for that and I try not to be upset about it. I know that I can't be a replacment for either of them, they've been together much longer, and have a mich deeper emotional connection. I'm fine with that; the world doesn't revolve around me. So I feel like I have a healthy outlook on that at least. But I still feel like what I do want is a pipe dream, and I never make any progress on improving myself. I think in terms like ""never"" even though it's been maybe three weeks. I'm not good at waiting or thinking long-term.

A few days ago I walked out of my lab because I felt close again, and went to the school counselors. I talked with a lady for a while, and it was mostly just me pouring out things that had happened or thoughts I was having and her nodding and writing down notes. But when I left, I had a completely different perspective that's difficult to put into words. I realized how to take a step back from all my friends and loved ones without discounting their support. I realized that nothing that could happen in the future would undo the happiness and memories with my partners. I felt more aware of my issues, and less like an outside observer who was just looking at them; now I understood them, internalized them, I knew I could fix them with the right help. I've felt better ever since, still broken but not in danger. I knew I would have bad days, like today, but I just need to vomit the thoughts out again, and I wanted to find a different audience than my loved ones, and give them some breathing room. I wanted to get this out, and then go back to behaving normally with them so that we can all start moving forward together again. I still don't like waiting for things to get better, and I'm still terrified of the future; and despite learning how to forgive myself, my actions and words still haunt me. But I know now that staying stuck in the past and letting my breakdowns control me will keep my relationship stuck as well, and possibly harm it. Instead, I want to move on and let my partners help me get better. I was worried about being too unhealthy for a relationship to be fair to them, and torn between the idea that people who love each other should be able to help each other through anything; and I think my recent attitude change is the difference between the two ideas. If I was unwilling to move forward, if every day was going to be breakdowns over the same thing and Ibwas making no effort to change, I wouldn't be able to maintsin a healthy relationship with them. But now I feel like, even though I'm broken, they will stand by me and help me heal and continue to love me.

"I don't see any optionsI probably don't deserve to be on this board because I am not really worth anyone 's time but I just can't stop crying and thinking dying is the only way to solve anything.  


Recently I've gotten into university against my own will because my parents believe that university is the only way I can get by in life and I believe it too, but it's been awful for me, I hate my classes and I don't like showing up there. I've been able to make a few friends which made me feel better but they've abandoned me and are only getting closer and closer as I watch them from afar every day. I don't really understand how it happened. Me and one friend in the group had a fight and I was wrong but was too stubborn to admit it, but aside from that, I don't really recall anything bad happening between us, but they've all just started being rude to me and distant, I reached out saying I didn't understand why it was happening and they all ignored me. I tried to reach out in DMs again and one person told me how toxic I was and that she felt like she was losing freedom, but I've never tried controlling her and I tried my best to be supportive, I reached out when she was very down with support, I shared very intimate parts of my life with them.  


I don't really know if I have been toxic or not. I was really aggressive back in the day, I had a troubled childhood, even though it's not an excuse, I just tried working on myself and I can't seem to be enough. I am falling behind classes and I can't get anything done. I feel terrible all the time but my parents won't let me drop out and I honestly don't see any other options. Every day I think about my friends but I feel like tehy just mock me in secret, I feel isolated by my peers and misunderstood by my family. I feel like the only way to escape is to die, that way life won't be difficult anymore.

"When everyone expects you to get better but they won’t support you at allEveryone tells me to just shut up and get over it.  They accuse me of making excuses but they aren’t all wrong.  Yet they won’t give an ounce of help, only just the general bs “it’ll get better.”  Like how the hell is it supposed to get better?  I know I’m supposed to figure that out, but what do people see in my situation that screams, “oh don’t worry, it’ll get better.”  My parents are literally holding me hostage and if I do anything to disobey them, I’m homeless and I’m probably gonna get abused by my ex again or raped by my other ex.  I’d rather stay here with my abusive parents than have that happen again.  “Just leave.”  That’ll make it worse.  “Just call the police.”  I live where?  “FOR FUCKSAKE GET UP OFF YOUR ASS AND DO SOMETHING INSTEAD OF WALLOWING IN SELF PITTY YOU ANNOYING IDIOT.”  I’m TRYING to not kill myself, mostly because I’m scared of surviving again.  And plus I’ve been really paranoid over what will actually happen when I die.  Will it be worse than this hell?  I don’t know.  And because my parents don’t believe in mental illnesses like my BPD, I don’t have anyone I can talk to or like up to.  The only person I have rn is myself and as hard as I try to be positive, the fact that I can’t go downstairs without getting shit on is just too much.  It’s really hard to be positive when your whole life is negative.  I’m taking my whole life.  No I ain’t got cancer and I ain’t starving, but I do feel like I’m dying and I do wanna starve myself, since my parents won’t shut the fuck up about my weight gain (yet buy fast food all the time and scream at me when I won’t eat it).  I’ve reached out to people and they don’t help.  In fact, they tell me that people don’t need to help me and that I need to deal with it myself.  Yet there they sit with a crowd of people for support.  How come I can’t get support.  “Stop looking for other people and just see a therapist.”  I have seen a therapist, a psychiatrist, and had inpatient treatment two times, the last time being late 2018.  But like I said, my parents don’t believe in mental illnesses, and will kick me out on the fucking streets if I even dare try to get any sort of professional help.  “Call the help line.”  Yeah I’ve tried, one of them told me to think about other people and how they’ll be hurt, then bitched at me when I said that my parents hate me and that I literally have NO ONE that cares.  I don’t have friends because I’m clingy and when I vent to them about my BPD, they go ape shit and claim I’m abusing them and tell everyone I’m a master manipulator.  Says the person that actually manipulated me into being a slave for them.  That’s the thing about BPD, everyone thinks your a sociopath and a liar.  I can’t get any help outside of therapy because there aren’t a lot of places to go without someone calling you a cunt.  All everyone talks about is “well my borderline mom killed my dad” “well my borderline sister stool my money.”  I’m not your stupid family member, I’ve never hurt anyone and I don’t plan on it either.  Stop treating me like I’m a terrible person, and then expect me to get better while you yell insult after insult after insult.  I tried so hard in 2018 to get my life back on track, and then I get raped, PTSD, lose my job, lose all my money after leaving an abusive relationship, and then get thrown back with my abusive mother because I tried to kill myself.  And I get shit on when I show an ounce of annoyance with.  “Well, you choose to get worse.”  No, I didn’t choose to get raped and get PTSD.  Sorry, I didn’t exactly plan on that.  I get told that I should die and I did.  Sorry, maybe that’s my fault.  But still, sorry my life sucks so badly that I’m basically stuck and telling me to shut up about it isn’t helping.  Maybe help me idk.  I tried reaching out to my college when my rapist enrolled.  They were gonna tell my parents, I had to drop out.  Now I’m actually stuck.  I just wanna die, even if I don’t want to rn.  But of course, nobody cares until you’re dead.  Or in my case, nobody cares regardless.  What should I do?  Rot to death?  Or get myself kicked out in the middle of a pandemic?  Maybe I am selfish and just a whiny little cunt.  Sorry I’m not a miracle.  Sorry I can’t get better in two months and play about it on social media, telling people that if they walk a mile, all their trauma and mental disorders will automatically heal.",,Depressed

"One of my friends is using suicide as a way to get clout on Tik Tok and I don’t know how to confront her about it Quick context: We live in America but Tik Tok’s still up, it’s just taken off the App Store, so as far as I know she’s going to continue doing it

So last year before the whole COVID thing, my friend, who we’ll call Sarah, liked to brag about how she’s Tik Tok famous. I think she had 10K followers at the time, I checked out her page once but it was just cosplays and dancing videos, so basically what you would expect on Tik Tok. I prefer the funny videos, but I decided to follow her just because we’re friends.

Since Corona, we haven’t been able to see each other. The last time I contacted her was sometime in March when my friend Cam said Sarah was refusing to text her, and since they’re best friends I texted Sarah to see what was up. She said she blocked Cam because she kept spamming her and she kept doing it when Sarah told her to stop. Since Cam is the type of person to spam subjectively bad memes and jokes, it’s understandable, and that was the last time we talked.

On Tik Tok I’ve recently seen her videos pop up more, it’s usually showing off her cosplays or doing a dance, exactly what she used to post. Sometimes I’ll see a post where it’s her standing in the back of a room and the screen just says “You should check up on your happy friends more. Trust me”. I know she’s dealing with some kind of anxiety because now she has 18K followers, a lot of which seem like kids by the way they seem to obsess over her in the comments. But recently in the videos she’s had a rope around her neck with the screen saying “I don’t know how long I can take it”. 

I’m not trying to say she doesn’t have depression or something else, it’s possible, and I acknowledge that. My problem is that her fan base is clearly very young and in the comments they seem extremely scared and worried. The videos have this certain tone where it feels like she’s saying her fan base is the only reason she doesn’t want to kill herself, and it’s like she’s putting a huge pressure on them that they have to keep her alive. Constantly threatening her life on them is doing more damage than she realizes. I notice those videos also get a lot of likes and comments, and she seems to be doing more of them, making me think she’s doing it for clout.

I have a small amount of followers on Instagram, about 4K people, a lot of which have told me I’m there favorite Instagram page, or that they love how I always ask how they’re day is because they feel like I care, so I understand what’s it like to have a small fan base, but I’m always careful with what I say, because I know I have more influence than I probably realize. I really want to call out Sarah and tell her she needs to stop, but I feel like if I do so and she does kill herself, I’ll be responsible.",,Anxious
"I absolutely hate Trump supporters, you absolute bigots. if you support trump, and you try and help him get elected, then you are pushing for the oppression of me and people like me. You are a bigot to the LGBT community, and i legitimately dislike you as a human being. You trump supporters will go down in the history books as the evil scumbags you are.

Heres a few things that trump supporters helped trump do, do hurt people like me. 

 

by supporting him youre enabling this. I seriously despise the fact that you people are ok with this.

Opposition to the Equality Act: Despite support from almost every segment of the U.S. population and a majority of Republicans, President Trump opposed the Equality Act. In May, the House passed the Equality Act, voting to guarantee critical non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people among other crucial rights. Appointed anti-LGBTQ judges: Trump has appointed anti-LGBTQ judges with alarming anti-LGBTQ records to appointments at every level of the judicial system, including anti-equality Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and federal nominees Kacsmaryk, Mateer, Bounds, Vitter. Menashi and others. Joked about Pence’s desire to hang LGBTQ people: In 2017, Trump joked about Vice President Pence’s anti-gay agenda saying “Don’t ask that guy—he wants to hang them all!” In the Workplace

Supported employment discrimination against LGBTQ people: The Trump administration submitted amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting discrimination against LGBTQ people. Banned transgender service members from the military: Against the expert advice of military leadership, medical authorities, budget analysts, 70% of Americans and the armed forces of allied countries, Trump and Pence banned transgender people from serving in the military. Rolled back Obama-era non-discrimination protections: Trump’s Department of Justice upended previous DOJ interpretations of the Civil Rights Act that protect transgender and non-binary workers from employment discrimination and ceased enforcing non-discrimination protections as well as taking a hostile stance to LGBTQ workers in court. Issued rule to license discrimination: Trump’s Department of Labor issued a regulation designed to allow federal contractors to claim a religious exemption to fire LGBTQ workers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Kicked people living with HIV out of the military because of their status: The Department of Defense instituted a “Deploy or Get Out” policy, which would remove military personnel living with HIV from service solely because of their status. Created a hostile work environment for LGBTQ federal employees: According to Politico: “\[The Trump administration\] fostered a climate where six staffers who are LGBT described removing their wedding rings before coming to work in the morning, taking down photos of their partners and families or ultimately finding new jobs further away from certain political appointees. They did not want to be identified; two said they feared being reassigned for being gay.” In Health Care

Undermine Section 1557 Rule: HHS published a proposed major change to the administrative rule interpreting Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to remove explicit protections for LGBTQ people in healthcare programs and activities by excluding LGBTQ people from protections from discrimination based on sex stereotyping and gender identity. Advocated for the elimination of the entire Affordable Care Act: The Justice Department issued a legal filing arguing that the entirety of the Affordable Care Act should be overturned. This move would jeopardize health care for over 130 million people with preexisting conditions like HIV and eliminate non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Created a Religious Discrimination Division: HHS created a new office whose sole purpose would be to defend physicians and other medical professionals who decide to refuse care, including to LGBTQ patients. Proposed cutting over $1.35 billion from PEPFAR budget:

Guidance for Schools on Transgender Students: The Departments of Education and Justice eliminated Obama-era guidance clarifying that schools must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity. This encourages schools officials to permit harassment of transgender students, deny access to facilities consistent with gender identity, and refuse to use correct names and pronouns -- all inflicting untold emotional harm. Rejected Complaints From Transgender Students: The Department of Education refused to respond to civil complaints filed by transgender students, including those who were barred from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. This increases the burden for transgender students to combat these harmful policies. Suggested it is acceptable for schools to discriminate against LGBTQ students while accepting tax-payer funds: Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has refused to rule out federal funding for schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students and has declined to state she would otherwise intervene should discrimination occur. Sexual Assault: DeVos rescinded Title IX rules related to schools’ obligations to address sexual harassment, including sexual violence. By eliminating the Obama-era rules, DeVos increased the standard of proof from “preponderance of the evidence” to “clear and convincing evidence” making it more difficult for survivors of sexual assault to obtain justice. LGBTQ people are disproportionately affected by sexual assault and harassment, and the stigma that many LGBTQ people face can make it more difficult for survivors to report. Eliminated language protecting LGBTQ children participating in the 4-H program: The Trump-Pence Administration ordered 4-H programs to remove a policy specifically welcoming LGBTQ children in the 4-H program, which led to the firing of an official who protested. Used Title IX to discriminate against trans students: the Department of Education claimed that school policies allowing trans youth to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity violated federal law and threatened to withhold funds. In Housing

Allowed emergency shelters to deny access to transgender and gender nonconforming people: Despite the fact that LGBTQ people are significantly more likely to experience homelessness in their lives, HUD Secretary Ben Carson has proposed a rule to permit emergency shelters to deny access or otherwise discriminate against transgender and gender nonconforming peoplewho are homeless. HUD also canceled a scheduled survey on LGBTQ homelessness. Placed transgender incarcerated persons in the wrong prison: The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) rolled back an Obama-era policy that housed transgender prisoners consistent with their gender identity. With transgender people experiencing sexual assault at higher rates than average, this decision only puts them at further risk of assault. In Families

Allowed foster care programs to discriminate while accepting tax-payer funds: Trump-Pence White House has proposed a federal regulation that would strip away nondiscrimination requirements and permit all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant recipients, notably adoption and foster care agencies, to discriminate against LGBTQ people, and in many circumstances religious minorities and women, and still receive federal funding. Refused visas to partners of diplomats: The State Department began refusing visas for same-sex partners of some diplomats and U.N. workers if they are not married. Changed rules to deny surrogate born children citizenship: The Trump Administration has interpreted immigration rules specifically so the child of a same-sex couple born abroad via surrogate would be considered ""born out of wedlock"" and making it more difficult to obtain U.S. citizenship. In Representation

Refusing LGBTQ asylum seekers fleeing violence: Trump issued an executive order to create further obstacles for all people seeking to enter the U.S., preventing refugees from escaping some of the most anti-LGBTQ regimes in the world. Embassy Pride Flags: Pence defended the State Department directive to ban U.S. embassies across the world from flying the LGBTQ Pride Flag during Pride Month. Left the U.N. Human Rights Council: Trump and Pence, over LGBTQ and other issues, removed the United States from the U.N. Human Rights Council. Chechnya: Trump and Pence refused to condemn attacks on LGBTQ people in Chechnya, where atrocities against queer people are horrific and ongoing. Brunei: The Trump-Pence administration has refused to condemn a Brunei law that imposes barbaric punishments on LGBTQ people, including death by stoning, torture and whipping.",,Anxious

I dropped out of school because I was bullied to the point of attempted suicide. I have no life and no future already, and i'm only 16.

You think you know someone and you think everything is so fucking fine and they just leave you there. No goodbye, no I still love you, no ""We can still make this work"".

Just ""I'm confused and hurt and i'm sorry""

I went to pick up my things from Joshuas house and tried to talk about everything, but he simply said he didn't love me anymore. I got most of my things (With the exception of two computers and my entire Star Wars and Star Trek movie collection) and left. As it turns out, he was in love with someone else, his ""best friend"" of five years and told me he was moving just to get me out of his life. He admitted to never caring for me after 2 months of dating me and only being with me because he was lonely. It's really a shot to the heart right there.

I took some painkillers, strong ones, that I was supposed to take for my tooth pain a few weeks ago. Everything spilled out to my mom and she confiscated my helium she had got me (Which she thought was for balloons for my grandmothers birthday)

"Academic Pressure Makes Me Suicidal (asian perspective)I'm a high schooler in the Bay Area. My friends are always talking about how many APs they're doing, or if they got a internship at some tech company over the summer, or about the new Android app they're building. I'm a freshman.

I feel like I'm drowning. My school is in a upper middle class suburb of Silicon Valley. It's majority Asian. All of my friend's parents work at some sort of tech company. One of my friend's parents work at Apple. Another at Microsoft. Another at Google. To say that the academic pressure is pretty damn intense would be an understatement. It's the type of school where kids sometimes flat out kill themselves due to the stress, the kind you hear about in the news. In my school there's this unspoken rule that you have to major in CompSci if you ""want to amount to anything""

The Asian parent stereotype is true. Every single part of it. I don't want to say anything more.

Im pulling a 4.0 right now but I literally cannot afford to get a single B. I would kill myself if that happened, and it probably will.

Sometimes I'm just sitting in Spanish class and I start to think about how much easier it would be just to hang myself instead of doing Algebra II homework. I just want the stress to end. I just want to not have to get up every morning at 5:30, and trudge through the California cold (it's legit cold in the morning, shut up) to go to school literally before the sun even rises. Slowly but surely my life is going out of control.

I haven't done SAT prep in a few months now, and I need to raise my sat by about a hundred points if I want any hope of getting into a decent UC, I have a science Olympiad meeting tomorrow morning for like 4 hours and it's 2:30 am so I guess I'm not getting any sleep.

"Not sure if this is where this goes....I have never been good at any sort of small talk so I will just jump right in...lately it seems the only thing I can think of is just how awful I am, I want nothing more than to kill myself and I have been feeling this way for maybe 4-5 months now. The only reason I haven't is because I thought I needed to stick around for my wife's sake. 

Let me explain. My entire life I was raised with severe anger issues, like the kind where I broke a kids nose in 4th grade because he looked at me weird (I have a massive port-wine stain birthmark covering half my face and most of my chest.) In my adolescence I was able to somewhat get in control of it. Though it does cause many problems still. Now I am 21 years old...I should be able to handle some fucking anger. But it seems I can't. 

Throughout my life I have never had a decent work ethic. And I have always had major problems with authority. It let to me barely passing HS (I officially recieved my last 12 credits after I got my diploma thanks to a very patient HS counselor) and not being able to hold down a job. 

I can't seem to think with any emotion unless it is in the extreme. I don't feel love until it is to an almost overwhelming amount. Part of gaining control over my anger issues was to learn to ignore emotion. Now people call me ""the robot"" because emotion hardly shows any more, not until it manifests in an overwhelming amount. 

Last thing before I describe the main issue, and this is where most of you, if not all of you, will call BS and stop reading. (not even sure why I type away on this post) no-one knows the true me, not because people have not tried, but more because the inner me truly does not want anything more than to burn everything. I know it sounds stupid or like I'm just young and don't know what the hell I'm talking about but, I often describe it to myself as, ""The Beast."" Now The Beast (TB)...just imagine the most hideous, disgusting, ferocious, beast you can and you get TB. Any time anyone gets near him, he, or rather I, hurt them. I don't know if I mean to or not but in the moment, it feels so right. After the fact however, I feel a tremendous sadness. 

Now to the issue at hand. Throughout the past 4-5 months. I have noticed a recent increase in my anger, lack of work ethic, and TB showing. These have all manifested throughout my marriage and, in me doing these things, I have literally trashed mine and my wife's life 4 times and we are on the cusp of the 5th. I have brought the most beautiful wen in the world, down to 5 extremely low and hopeless points. (she already suffers from depression, diagnosed at 6 yrs) I have brought her to near suicide 5 times now...I can't seem to get the approval of my parents, let alone hers. I just don't feel like anyone truly cares for me anymore. My family only ever talks to me when they need something heavy lifted. Her family barely talks to me. And she (unfortunately) is truly the kind of person that would stay in this marriage for the sake of not having the embarrassment of divorcing me what with her super religious parents. 

Everything in my life is going downhill...again, and today for the first time ever, I actually created a plan to kill myself. I have often contemplated suicide. But I have never created a plan until today. I was in a subreddit post (don't remember which subreddit) today about different creative ways to kill myself to make it look like an accident. And someone there suggested I come here for help. I don't know what any of you can say to help me but honestly. Creating a plan today...it scared me. And reading different easy to kill myself today sacred me even more, I don't think I can be helped but I thought that it couldn't hurt anything either. And really, I am looking for help foot myself so I can maybe try to stick around for my wife. Though I'm not sure she will be around much longer either. 

For those that made it this far, thank you. And thank you in advance to any replies, if any replies come.

Sorry for long post.

TL:DR. I have failed myself, my wife, and my family 5 times in the last 2 years to the point where I literally ruin everything in sight. I want nothing more than to end it all.",,Depressed

"Considering killing myself, the depression just keeps strangling me.I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, since i was a little kid i've been this way. This winter my abusive girlfriend left me and i still can't get over her completely.

Nothing happened between us, we barely spoke but we were in the same company over the weekend and i had a great time but now the weekend is over and same old shit week after week continues.

"Censorship in my country. Situation that really angered me Okay, it's a very local problem but I just wanted to share it with other people cause it really angered and shocked me. 

So I'm living in Ukraine. Democratic country with the freedom of speech, you know. 

We have a YouTube channel called ""Geekjournal"" which reviews films, series and Ukrainian television. And a couple of days ago this channel a video about one of our TV channels (called 1+1 if you're interested but I'm quite sure noone read till this moment). So this 1+1 chanell threw 4 strikes on this video (I'm not sure is this correct in English) even though Geekjournal didn't violate copyright law.

The problem is not even in the fact that this channel is going to be blocked. The problem is that this situation violates the freedom of speech.This is harsh unreasonable censorship, something on the scale of what was in the USSR.

The optistic thing is that many Ukrainian YouTubers defend Geekjournal. Many people in social media cover this topic and support this channel. There are tons of negative comments on the official account of 1+1 in Instagram. The hashtag #savegeekjournal became number one in Ukrainian Twitter. I hope the situation will be resolved fairly.

"Smoke weed to forget how much I want to dieMy bf hates that I smoke weed.

"There's a wall and I know what's on the other side of it.m not talking about an afterlife in the title, or anything like that. I don't know if others struggle with this. But it's sad because you know what's on the other side of the wall. You know they are speaking to you, the sound just can't reach you. And you're listening but not understanding.

This wall I'm speaking of is the ability of some to be able to generate love for others, sometimes in the deepest and most genuine of ways, but lacking the ability to feel it. The person knows they are leaving something behind, that there's definitely something that will be left behind, but they just can't experience joy or love or anything like that. It's not sociopathy or something particularly malevolent. It's more like an exercise video playing but you're trapped in a wheelchair.

That's the worst part. I think many end it all because they feel hopeless or lost, but there needs to be some metacognition of ""what's the root cause of this hopelessness? Is it truly actionable?""

My username isn't a joke. I've been compared humorously to Rick Sanchez, but I'm not that smart. But I'm not someone who idolizes the character. If anything, I try to work against having anything in common with his personality. That's the point of antiheroes. You like them, but never want to step into their shoes. And I feel like if I haven't conquered this problem by now, at the age of 27, I may never conquer it. I feel like I'm watching the world as a movie and I'm alone in the theater.

Everyone says it gets better, but what about those that are just relentlessly crushed into smithereens? Do those that make it past that not have the self awareness? Do they not have the intelligence to process how all of this means nothing?

I'm wondering on when to end things. I want to around mid-December. After group projects are wrapped up (some people depend on me for their coursework), I'm most likely going to do it. I wrote my will today, started drafting the letter, and bought an exhaust hose. I told the buyer it was for my brother in law mechanic, because it seems like to morally travel to the end willingly is a little hard to do. I hate lying, so I try to avoid it at all costs.

I know there's people who care and love me. I just can't feel it anymore. I'm locked in an iceberg in front of the sun. I know those people are calling out to me, but I can't hear them over this wall. I can't be the only one that feels like this.",,Depressed

"[Serious] Some advice for highschoolers + my mental health, I guess I need to vent. Usually, I tend to stay away from this subreddit, I'm just not a fan of some of the content here, though that may sound stupid. 

Anyway, I'm 15 right now coming to the last 3 months of the second semester of high school. I am doing well in most of my classes, with my rough point being the Honors Geometry that I am currently in, but thats a B, with my other classes being A's or B+. 

To be honest, I have been VERY, VERY stressed out, and I feel like I have been developing anxiety- or atleast thats what my teachers are telling me because to be honest the though of Algebra II has scared me, and that led to thoughts about ""what if I don't make college?"" or ""I need a diploma for most jobs and Alg 2 is required, what do i do?!?""

Basically, I kinda blame the way school works to a certain degree but also I blame myself. Ever since I got out of that, with the growth of online classes in my 10th grade and now just going back, I remember little to no Algebra I. It gives me anxiety everyday kind of and I have been getting better, being able to calm down a but by reading and exercising, as well as being with friends.

The main thing I remember is basic equations, like (example) 4x + 2 = 3x + 4 and solving that, as well as finding out how to work out triangles.

People in school say the first semester of Alg 2 is re-learning 1 and then sem 2 is working on new skills.

THE ADVICE: Keep algebra 1 notes and assignments to review.

To be honest, this is my first vent of this topic as I would rather keep it to myself, but I feel like talking would be better.

I have kept my work, and I know my notebook should be somewhere, but seriously folks- KEEP YOUR NOTES. I am just so stresses out from it, and most other kids in my grades are the same way.

Thank you if you read this. I needed to get this out I guess. Also, can anyone confirm that I will be relearning Alg 1? Please. I cant remember for the life of me, the online learning messed with me very hard and I just dont fee motivated anymore.",,Anxious

But now it’s all coming to bite me in the ass, because progress reports are tomorrow, and I am failing 5 classes.

So basically I have to get straight A’s, which I don’t do (I am an A/B honor roll student) and right now I am failing 5 classes. It isn’t the work is hard, per say, it’s just I am not doing it. I am in gifted classes, so that means I have an unusual amount of work, and I only have tomorrow to finish.

Work is falling apart, but going into it might identify me. With that said, my relationship of 5+ years seems to be ending, and I don't know what the hell to do about it. I've put so much effort into being the right person for her with the internal understanding that I would do whatever it takes to make her happy and build a life with her. I've helped her get away from (what I was told was) a physically abusive ex-fiance, reconnected and helped her rebuild broken relationships with family that's lives 7-8 hours away, gotten the blessing of her grandfather to propose about a year before he passed away and helped bury him, helped care for our neice and nephew through her sister who treats them poorly, brought her to the emergency room multiple times to take care of an illness that was in her mind, helped her through going back to a psychologist on a weekly basis, endured as she cheated on me multiple times, make sure to give her all the attention I can, always tell her how much I love her, how smart she is, how beautiful she is, and build her self esteem that was crushed for years by her mom, take all the yelling in a call fashion, make sure to surprise her with flowers and new experiences every chance I got, took her on her first plabhe ride, helped her overcome her fear of heights to take her on roller coasters and skydiving, and so much more.

I thought that loving someone principally meant that you pledge yourself through the good times and the bad.

Now, everything I say is being classified as manipulative, lying, or in some negative light. I've never lied to her once! 

Lately, she told me she got a house and wanted me to move in there with her, even though we already live in a good house provided by my work. She started smoking again, even though she's taking prenatal and we planned on conceiving in December! Somehow, everything I say is wrong, and I cannot find a way to move forward. I want more than anything to make her happy. It's always been a cycle of her doing something wrong, apologizing, and asking for forgiveness. Now, she's treating me very poorly and acting like I'm the one doing things wrong. I apologize anyway, and she just wants to keep yelling or scolding me...

I don't know what to do, and I keep thinking about ways to commit suicide... hanging, getting a gun, the right combination of pills... the main thing that stops me tight now is... what if I fail? I don't know what the hell to do...

I have tried so hard to keep pushing and hide stuff. But knowing that my parents can see through that and think that there could ever be something that they did to contribute to that CRUSHES ME.

"All the reasons I'm suicidal.I have autism spectrum disorder. Because of it I cannot drive, hold a job, and I have amere  handful of online friends that live about two hours away. I have been abused emotionally, physically, and at times, sexually by my father for my entire life. He is a narcissist. My mother has stood around doing nothing about it and now abuses me to a lesser extent as well. 

Before anyone pulls out that disgusting line ""well you're an adult it's your fault for not getting help when you were a minor now you can just move out""

1- I did TRY to get help. From teachers. School counselors. They did nothing. I  have told COPS for fucks sake, COPS about my abuse and was told I DESERVED IT. Psychiatrist s that my parents took me to in order to stuff me with medication I didn't need did nothing. The one time child protective services did come to my house I was put in the same room as my dad who was staring me down the entire time. 

2- yes I am an adult. A disabled one, who is unable to support myself. How do you expect me to move out?? 

3- it is not my fault I was and still am being abused. It is never the victim's fault. How dare you.

4- when you are abused emotionally at all and especially me since it started pretty much when I was born, you are trained to intensely fear leaving your abuser for no rational reason by the abuser because the abuser doesn't want you to leave. It's not easy to walk out under those circumstances and even more so when you know you'll end up on the streets or that your abuser may become violent and attack you which is more likely than not to happen.

5- Even in adulthood, if you are disabled like me there is an organization to help you called adult protective services. It's a useless and corrupt organization that did nothing to help me and lead to my abuse worsening.


Earlier this year I was sexually assaulted by a coworker. I quit to avoid seeing him but i was losing my job anyway. On top of that, my abusive parents constantly nagged me about him. "" why did you break up with X"" "" why don't you see X again"" ""so you two are really over?*  they only stopped asking when I finally lost it and threw a bunch of housewares at my mother in response. My dad called the police but they refused to arrest me because

1. I'm disabled 
2. They told my parents that what they were doing was considered harassment in itself because of the amount of distress it was causing me and that if he had to come back to our house again he would probably have to arrest them instead.

Of course my parents never dared call the police after the one time a cop actually did something right

I neglected to tell anyone about the assault however because I hate the legal system for how it's failed me and also because I didn't want to push myself anymore with the amount of anxiety, PTSD, and depression I already have from my parents I just wanted (and still want) to forget about it all.

My parents also gave me a ton of grief for quitting my job which added to everything else I already had going on

But the thing is, my parents don'tunderstand what autism is. I know because I asked them. My mom said something like "" I have no idea, that's why I want to see X speech about it "" and I repeatedly tell her that I can explain it to her but she ignores this and keeps insisting she learn about autism from a guy who don't even have it instead of me who does. They expect me to do things I obviously can't do no matter how many times I explain it. My father calls. Me a loafer and a lazy bum etc  when it's been statistically proven that fee people with autism can get any sort of  decent job and have trouble driving.

Some of the worst things he's said to me are that he wouldn't care if I died or got raped, and that im ""mentally slow"" which if it's even true is clearly caused by my maltreatment he also gushes a lot about how he's going to put me in a mental home which he can't because I'm 20 and he isn't legally authorized to do anything against my will and putting me in jail which he can't either because I don't do anything illegal except maybe when I lash out when he is abusing me which even if it wasn't for a reason, wouldn't put me in jail anyway because I'm disabled.

I'm also FtM transgender and because I can't keep jobs I doubt I could pay to transition


And as for the rest of my family. Let's just say they're not much better. I don't care if they're sad when I'm gone because they don't even know me, my parents and my siblings don't know me. All of them treat me like scum. And beside all that, it doesn't matter. I wasn't put on this earth to please them. I was put here to live my own life.


But I can't. Because no one will help me and Instead mu eentire family nakes sure I have no human rights.

"I went to see a psychiatrist today. He spent 15 minutes yelling at me.Last month I was going to kill myself and for some stupid fuck reason I didn't. I let someone talk me into not doing it. I got sent to a hospital who then kicked me out with a 1-800-SUICIDE hotline and a $400 ambulance bill. No one to really talk to or anything. One of them mentioned a mental health place that I've been going to, but that's not helping much either. The guy I see (Bic) had set up an appointment with a psychiatrist for today. Now I've been depressed for my entire life. I'm 23 years old and I don't remember a singular day I've been happy. 

I get in to see him and he's 30 minutes late. Whatever, it's fine. He has to travel to this tiny town to even help people. Whatever that's cool. Then he asks me my information. I give it to him, birthday, name, etc. He then asks for my Provincial Health Card number. I tell him I don't have one. He then launches into a huge tirade asking how I expect for the services to be paid for and what not. I tell him I don't and the whole thing is just a clusterfuck and I had explained this. He yelled at me some more asking why I didn't have one if I've been here for months. I tell him it's difficult to get and I didn't have the necessary proof of residency. He complains some more then changes the topic. He asks why i'm there. I explain that Bic set up the appointment. He says ""So you're fine?"" I say ""I'm depressed everyday."" ""But you're not suicidal?"" ""I have no reason why I haven't killed myself when every day I want to die."" Then he yells at me some more about how I should have told him that ahead of time and I'm just wasting all of his time there today. 

Then he asks about family history of mental health issues and when I can't give him any concrete answers other than I think my mother was on prozac about 10 years ago, he launches into me again saying I should have had this information. Never mind the fact that my family is estranged from me because I'm gay. 

To wrap the whole fucking bow up, when he gives me a prescription (which I can't fucking afford) he says ""If you're feeling suicidal, just try to not act on it. Call 911 if you need to."" AKA do what I did last time and get another $400 ambulance bill for being suicidal. 

I went in today with a tiny amount of hope and got met with absolutely fucking nothing. All I got was yelled at. WHY THE FUCK?! What did I fucking do to deserve all of this? I have no one in my life I can talk to, I'm totally fucking alone. Now I'm getting yelled at by someone because of something thats out of my hands? 

I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself tonight. I just dont see a reason not to anymore. I was looking forward to this but even he's screaming at me.

It's been going great lately, I've been studying the subject I always wanted and it was just great overall. I've always told her I did't have a childwish. My girlfriend  was on the pill our entire relationship, she quit 2 months ago because she wanted to get a different form of anticonception, but decided on none.   


A few days ago she send me a picture of a positive pregnancy test and since then my world has fallen apart. I've told her I did't want children, atleast not at this moment. She just told me she's keeping the child.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then it's all been spiraling down for me, I can't pay attention to a lot of stuff, am constantly in a sort of panic and just sad overall. I've told her this and she keeps telling me it's just shock and it'll wear off. Which I am convinved it won't. I've also told her I've been thinking about suicide, which she just told she is lucky I would't have the balls for it. I fear I might have to quit school and move across the country because we're long distance. My world is just upside down right now.

"So this girl I liked turned out to be lesbian and I’m frustrated rn I’m just devastated. I’m not gonna share too much of my personal business since it’s possible someone I know can find this out 😬 but I don’t know what to do.  To provide some context here’s what our relationship is like. Around the age of 7 I moved in with my uncle because of my parents which I won’t go into detail about. She was a neighbor so I guess u can call her a childhood friend. We went to the park together, went to amusement parks arcades and even 2 vacations. One to the Grand Canyon and the other to Las Vegas. The Las Vegas one was a little over a year ago before covid. At that time we were 16 and now I am 16 and she is 17. A few months older than me. As you can tell we are extremely close and during COVID we hung out a lot on our own. I’ve been wanting to tell her how I feel but I have always been too embarrassed and scared of rejection. I don’t mind her rejecting me as long as we can still be close friends, I’m cool with that. But I still have my doubts that she will feel the same. I hate when ppl break up as friends after a confession, its so easy to just forget and move on but I know that’s not the case. So (I’m gonna make up a place for the sake of privacy) we go to Bobs burgers a week and a half ago and not many people are there since it’s early in the morning. We order 2 double cheeseburgers and sit at the back of the restaurant. As we are talking she looks unnaturally nervous which is very out of the ordinary. I ask her to let loose and tell me what’s been bothering her. I don’t like seeing her like that. She tells me that she has been struggling with her identity for a while. This is what made my heart sank because as you know I have a huge crush on her. “How do you feel about it?” I ask her? I’m not good in serious situations like this and I never know the right thing to say... She then tells me that she thinks she is gay. That for the past couple months she has been looking at girls more and more and guys aren’t doing it for her. I say “Well you haven’t been with a guy before as far as I know so maybe you are lesbian. Makes since to me since you know, you seem to like girls” Time goes on and she seems to agree. The next day she calls me and we have an hour long talk about how she feels lesbian is the right term for her and that she is confident in her choice. So there it is, she is gay. I tell her in happy for her and we have fun talking for a bit more but after we hang up I start panicking a bit. I really love her and I’m happy but I thought we were a great match. I haven’t talked to any other girls since a bit after the first time I encountered her at 7. (I wasn’t flirting at that age but I did like hanging with other girls since you know I wasn’t into the idea of a relationship at that time). I won’t be confronting her ever since I respect her choice but I can’t stop having short breaths when I’m around her. Guys plz any advice on moving on mentally? I can’t stop thinking about her and I refuse to date just for the sake of not to think about her. That’s not fair to the other girls. I just finished working on one of my final projects and so I had so much time to type this out. In sorry for this long story but plz I could use some support rn, even if it’s virtual.",,Anxious

A little backstory, I'm a 15 year old boy and I've been in a relationship with this girl for a little over four months now.

A couple nights back, me and my girlfriend were laying on my bed chilling, when I was rubbing her ass and was feeling horny. I started rubbing around her clit area and I think by this point she had fallen asleep. I'm pretty sure that at one point I tried to finger her but didn't and rubbing around her clit area was as far as it went. When she woke up I felt instantly guilty and felt so awful. I cannot remember if I was fully aware that she was asleep or not but either way I felt like a horrible sex offender and almost burst into tears. I spoke to her about it shortly afterwards and she has told me that what I did does not violate her boundaries and even if I did finger her that would still have been consensual. She said that I should stop worrying and being anxious about it because I have done nothing wrong and have not violated her boundaries.

"I should just do itIt’s like the thought suicide just hangs over my head and lingers even when I’m having a relatively “good day” like today. I got out of bed before noon, showered, ate two meals, and even exercised which is a stark difference to the past few weeks. But now that I’m in bed I can’t stop thinking I should just hang myself or overdose or jump off a bridge. 

I feel like I’ve ruined my life and it’s call coming to an end. I lost my scholarships and financial aid due to my shitty grades so I can’t return to school until I pay for this semester but I’m unemployed. I feel like a giant loser because I’ve been trying desperately to find a job, but it’s just been auto-rejection e-mails. With the coronavirus, my family needs my financial support so I’ve been draining my measly savings but I’m running out soon. 

Besides those issues, I’ve just been depressed for years and trying to deal with BPD and anxiety as well but I don’t have insurance so I have no access to therapy or medication. I started the process of therapy and trying to get medication through my school but at this point I’ve basically flunked out. 

I’ve been trying to hard to take everything a day at a time but I feel an overwhelming loneliness on top of everything. Everyday I just feel like nobody loves or cares about me and despite having a few friends, they can’t spend every moment talking to me so I’m basically alone everyday just going through the motions. And I’m just not close with my family, particularly my mom who abused me when I was younger and the rest have always scapegoated me and treated me like a servant. I feel numb all day like I’m on auto-pilot then I get in bed and I think ”Is this really my life?” 

It feels like I’ve been set up to fail in life no matter how hard I try and it’ll make no difference to anyone if I just die. My family can move on because they were never happy with me around and my friends probably wouldn’t even know and just move on. It’ll just be a sad memory occasionally but they’ll move on. 

My life really is completely worthless and everyday I spend alive is wasting space and resources. Even with my issues with money and school and mental health, I’d feel better if I knew I had people behind me rooting for you. People who told me they loved me and cared if something happened to me.

"Proof no one cares until you’re deadA schoolfriend of mine killed herself recently. She was popular but whenever she showed signs of mental distress e.g an eating disorder, excessive alcohol consumption, people would scoff at her, make fun of her, call her attention seeking. (I hadn’t seen her for a couple of years but there were presumably other signs before she died that people ignored). After she killed herself the same people who made fun of those worrying signs are now the ones saying how upset they are, how they loved her so much, how beautiful she was (idk why people always say this?), how much they’ll miss her etc.

I see this as proof that no one cares when someone is struggling mentally, but suddenly everyone cares when they kill themselves. I suppose death and suicide are seen as tragic whereas a mentally ill friend is just seen as a nuisance.",,Depressed

"Advice on guys, from a— My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married.

After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.

"Carefully Planning a SuicideHello people.

So...  here is my story. I suppose that is an EGO thing to want to talk about one's story, but...  Anyway...

I am the youngest of six siblings. Half of us, three brothers to be exact, have already committed suicide. My life is marked by sadness and trauma since I was a young boy.

I think that once this door is opened, it then becomes an obvious way out of life, should the need arise.

I'm just past fifty, a male, a loner, always stumbling into depression just like a person intermittently, while walking along life's  crooked pavement, falling flat on their face into life's puddles...

I have cut all my ties to relatives. I have no children. I do not have a partner. I am an atheist. Nobody will notice if I walk out of this crazy marketplace of bullshit.

Please do not try to tell me that GOD is THE answer! For me, it is not... no more than Mickey Mouse is my savior.

I have my suicide quite well planned. I am going to hang myself. First I will drink alcohol to prepare for physical pain and to numb my senses enough for me to carry this plan out. Just before I hang myself I will send a text message to Police with the coordinated of my location, which will be in the woods outside the city I live in. I do not want children or sensitive people to be traumatized by my actions.

When? Answer: At the turn of the year.

Why am I posting this here? Answer: I guess I'm just using you, in a way. That is probably egocentric, on my behalf. Sorry! I guess I feel this is a safe space to talk about such matters because of the great divide that the internet brings. You can not intervene in person but you can state your opinions from a safe distance...

I have been thinking about this for many years. I should have killed myself many years ago. There is nothin left but sadness and hopelessness!

Anyway, climate change will extinguish our civilization in a few years, anyway !

Sorry for any grammatical or typographical errors I might have made in the text. I try to be accurate, but to be blunt... I have had a couple of glasses of red wine...

"What should I get for a former student of mine who just got a full ride to her dream school? Hello young people,

I'm a middle school teacher working in a large urban district. One of my former students, who is brilliant, hardworking, and kind, just got a full ride to a very competitive university. We've stayed in touch over the years, and she'd occasionally check in when she needed help with something or just to say hi. When she told me she was accepted, I was ecstatic for her and congratulated her.

I asked if I could share the news with our school's staff, since we always love to hear about our former students' successes, and she told me that she's feeling like she may have made a mistake. She says she's feeling some serious imposter syndrome (she's a POC, and this school is largely white and affluent), and she's worried she can't hack it. I told her that she can definitely hack it, and we talked for a while, but it still seemed at the end like she's feeling more than what I'd say is the ""normal"" amount of anxiety about a life transition.

I'm just thinking about my experience (as a privileged white dude) in college and how hard it was, and I'd like to get some of our staff to chip in to buy her something nice as a reassurance that she can, in fact, thrive there.

So my question for the younger folks here is: what should we get her? Her family doesn't have a ton of money, so I was thinking maybe a laptop would be nice, or gift cards, or...what? I haven't been to college since before Facebook was a thing, so I don't want to arrange to get her something that won't be useful.

Anyway, thanks in advance!",,Anxious

"I still think about it whenever I'm the first car stopped at an intersectionI thought I had put these kinds of thoughts behind me. But I still get them.

I'll be driving and everything will be fine. Automatic. Easy. But then the light will turn and I'll slow to a stop and I'll be the first one waiting for the light to change. Where I live, every intersection is big and busy. When the cars start rushing across in front of me, I get this *itch*. This nagging voice in my head that it'd be so easy just to let my foot slip on the brake and inch out. Or maybe slam on the gas and sent myself rocketing into traffic. And it'd be over. And I wouldn't have to worry about the consequences anymore. I wouldn't have to worry about the little things. Bills, work, cleaning, medical insurance. I could just be free of it.

Or sometimes, I think about how easy it would be to swerve just a little bit and wrap myself around a tree. How it could be chalked up to me texting while driving. Or having a seizure, or just being careless.

I dream about it too. For a while, I wasn't sure what exactly the dreams were about, but I think I know now. I get these dreams where I slamming my foot down harder and harder but my van can't or won't stop in time and I slam into traffic. I just realized the other night though that it isn't about me slamming on the breaks-- it's about me slamming on the gas.

My fiance used to bug me all the time about how I'm terrible about going out and doing errands without her. Part of the truth of it is, driving scares me. And she knows I hate driving so she lets it slide a lot. But the bigger truth of it is, I'm scared of myself. I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid.

I told her years ago about it. But I think like me she had hoped it was something in the past. I'm not going to tell her that I still feel this way. I burden her with shit constantly, she doesn't need that on her mind too.

I used to think that I'd be lucky to make it to adulthood. Failing that, I wasn't sure I'd make it to my 21st birthday. And younger me thought for sure I wouldn't make it out of my 20's.

Things are a lot better now. I'm 21, and in some ways I like myself a lot more than I used to. But I think I'm a bit more fucked up than I'm wiling to admit. My family has very few health problems. Physically, we tend to live long lives. But god damn does crazy run on every single side of my family. When I confided in my momma as a teenager that I thought I might have depression, she brushed me off. She then went on to start antidepressants a couple years later. I know I should probably be on them too. They'd probably help some. But for the life of me I can't admit to myself that I need them, no matter how much my life starts to spiral out of control in the little ways. My health insurance situation is a mess, and I can't afford to get meds right now. And I dissolve into a panic attack whenever I even think about trying to set up an appointment.

Anyways.

I don't know if anyone feels the same way. But I needed to get this off my chest. Because I've been struggling the last couple weeks.

Love y'all &lt;3",,Depressed

"ugly fat ugly fat inferior unfit WORTHLESS specimenFor the third time this week I was rejected by a tinder match after they found out I was a natural blonde. I’ve even had a date say EW to my face when she found out. I dye my eyebrows brown so it isn’t immediately obvious. Then just now my most recent match blocked me after asking if I was naturally blonde. I feel like fucking shit. Born inferior. Born worthless. Never able to be a man. I know it’s true that as a male, being blonde is at least a three to four point reduction in attractiveness if not a complete dealbreaker. I can’t change that. But I can change other things. I don’t eat anymore and I have not in a long time. I was 230 lb last summer and I am 168 now (I am 6’3”). Mewing. I beat myself on the cheekbones too in hopes of making them a little more prominent. Saving up for plastic surgery. I have half a mind to never speak to anyone I get until I get it. I am so ugly that people want me dead just for existing. I’m not some incel, I have had a pretty dynamic and vibrant sex and dating life for a long time and I don’t know why none of that validation sticks with me. I don’t know anything. I wish I was a brunette. I’m so subhuman. I can literally never look masculine or handsome because of my disgusting putrid blonde genes. I have been hanging curtains over my mirror at this point because its tok hard to look at myself. im drowning, i dont know what to do, how can i accept being SO inferior",,Depressed
"Isolated Suicidal Numb Weirdo GirlJust FYI I don't hate myself, that is a literal description if what I am. At this point I'm just getting bored of living.

Its fucked up. I ran away and pretty much got rid of everyone in my life because they were treating me worse that shit. Worse than rat shit.

I'm so angry...all I ever try to do is make people not hate me (I gave up on being likeable) and somehow I am either ignored or looked at sideways.

Now I'm living alone, nobody to talk to. I work, come home, eat, and waste time until I'm tired enough to sleep.

I really give up on trying to find my place in society but that doesn't change the fact that maaaaybe it would be nice to talk to someone? Like for real...just be genuine and be able to relate to someone

The hollow feeling I get is unbareable hence why I want to kill myself occasionally. Tonight is one of those occasions.

But I know I won't do it. I'll just have to keep living, being bored, being lonely...whatever

Maybe one day someone will just kill me. Maybe I can trip down the stairs and crack my skull open

"Tik Tok isn't that bad Before I get downvoted to hell, hear me out. Feel free to discuss this in the comments. Sorry if this is a bit incomprehensible, English isn't my first language.

I know that people on this site have had horrible experiences with Tik Tok, like getting hair shaved, &gt;!pedophiles!&lt;, etc etc. But I'd like to remind you that, just like Reddit or any other site, Tik Tok has separate communities (Art, POVs, Fandom, etc). I'd like to turn your attention to the two biggests separate communities (in my opinion) are Straight/Gay Tik Tok. Let me show you the difference.

Half naked people dancing? **Straight Tik Tok.**

History lessons that school doesn't teach due to homophobia and transphobia? **Gay Tik Tok.**

Romanticizing abusive relationships? **Straight Tik Tok.** 

How to make earrings out of almost anything? (and I mean almost anything. I've seen someone with Monster High Dolls earrings.) **Gay Tik Tok.** 

&gt;!Pedophilla and sexualization of minors?!&lt; **Straight Tik Tok.**

Content that might save lives? **Gay Tik Tok.**

Yes, I am aware that not everyone on Straight Tik Tok promotes toxic behavior and that there are some people on Gay Tik Tok that are a bit yikes. But so are people on this platform. I guess what I'm trying to say is to choose who you surround yourself with. This may be a bit biased, seeing that I'm trans and bs around on Gay Tik Tok, but my point still stands. 

Also some people pretend to be cities, colours, and food on Tik Tok, and I find that very cute :).

"It’s obvious my little brother is my mom’s favorite and damn it hurts. It’s completely obvious. For starters, I was payed for. When I say that, I mean my parents thought one of them was infertile. So, I was “made” as my mom says. 2 months later, my mom’s pregnant again, without the help of a doctor, meaning they could have had a kid all along. That kid is my little brother.

We grew up in a pretty bad environment. Our parents fought, we were poor, we lived with 4 other people in a 2 bedroom house, one of them was a drunkard, one was banging the drunkard (They were first cousins), one was my grandma with dementia, and the final one was my bitch of a Great Grandma. After we moved out of there, it was a constant financial battle with us going from 5 in a 3 bedroom apt (Grandma came with us), to a 5 in 2. 

We were also spoiled to high hell. We (most of the time) got what we wanted and got stuff even when we didn’t ask. At first, I was kinda spoilt. Sometimes, I wouldn’t get my own drinks unless told to, and I’d procrastinate doing chores. I eventually grew out of it, but not my brother. He was worse. Lately, he’s gotten better; but before this, he’d call everyone assholes if he didn’t get what he asked for, when we didn’t get him his lunch (Which was very basic and needed no effort whatsoever) he wouldn’t eat, and worst of all, when he was annoying me and I asked him to stop, he wouldn’t. So I’d ask him again and again until I had to yell or push him off me. He’d proceed to call me names under his breath but juuusst loud enough for me to hear him, he’d be passive aggressive all day, and somehow even worse, my mother would SUPPORT THIS BEHAVIOR! If he ever got really mad, she’d offer to take him shopping and usually come back with a coke. On the off chance, he’d be poking at me or something and I’d ask him to stop. My mom would come in and ask ME to leave. I would be talking with my friends on discord and she’d tell ME to leave? Today, I was playing Xbox with my friends when something scared me, and I gasped. When I was talking to my friends about it, he cut me off and started trying to get my attention about something. After I didn’t reply, he got really bitchy and threw shit at me. My mom came in and asked me to leave, despite the fact *He* was overreacting. Make him leave! When I don’t defend myself, and tell my parents, he keeps pushing my stuff on the floor on purpose saying “oops”. If I tell them again, either my mom offers to take my brother to go get a cookie, basically rewarding him, or I get told that *I’m* wrong.

I’ve supported her lots. I’d helped her through her backpain caused by an car accident by massaging her back and making it feel better. I’d hand her water and tell her it’ll be alright after fights with my dad, even though I was holding back tears of my own because of what was happening. We only fight once in a full moon, and even then they weren’t very bad. When we do fight, she’s 50% of the time completely wrong. She’d never apologized about that.

Now, my brother on the other hand, treats her like shit. He yells at her, hit her one time, demands her around, and doesn’t even try to acknowledge the fact that he’s her son. It angers me that she lets him get away with this.

"Is it bad that I feel like crap for buying a ps4 Back story: so my dad and mom are divorced and my dad lives in another city but will be moving back to the city me and my brothers live at with our mother. I was staying at my dads house for a week like I do sometimes, to spend time with him because otherwise I would only see him twice a month.

So the other day I was playing God of War on the ps4 and a friends house and I thought it was really cool and a really good game. I wanted to keep playing but we had to go. On the way back home, in the car I was talking to my dad about how I really liked the game and wish I could play more. I kinda hinted at the idea of getting the ps4 but I’m pretty sure I didn’t straight up say “we should get a ps4”. Also getting a ps4 isn’t something totally impulsive I just thought of, I’ve actually been thinking of it for a while but never seriously. At the end we ended up saying if we find one cheap we could get it for his new apartment. I felt happy because I would get to play new games on the ps4 and just happy to get a new gaming system. A couple days later after we bought it and spent like 500 on not just the ps4 but also on a couple games and 2 extra controllers so I can play with my brothers. But like two minutes after the purchase I started feeling kinda crappy. I thought of what my brothers would say because we already have an Xbox one (but it is like six years old and doesn’t work perfectly anymore but still) also they’re the kind of brothers who will spend 100 dollars on a pair of shoes but yell at me for wasting money for buying snacks at seven eleven. Now, a couple years ago when my family wasn’t doing so good with money buying a ps4 was totally out of the question but now my dad is doing really well financially and now I keep telling my self that it was his money and his decision and that he could’ve said no if he wanted to but I keep feeling like I just made a huge mistake and a total waste of money. Also I want to add that I didn’t just blindly buy one, I did a lot of research and wrote down the best deals and where the cheapest price are and watched tons of reviews and comparisons but I still feel like crap.

"Did you lose friends after an attemptI made a suicide attempt recently (took sleeping pills) and thankfully I survived unharmed after a friend rushed me to the hospital where I spent a week. I am now recovering mentally and emotionally and I currently don’t have suicidal thoughts.

However, several of my closest friends have pulled away from me or turned against me.

The friend who took me to the hospital (who was my main source of support for the past year) has completely withdrawn and refuses to communicate with me (he says he doesn’t hate me and that we will remain friends in the future, but that he currently needs zero contact).

A few close friends who were informed of my attempt as I was still unconscious in the hospital formed a Facebook group chat to try to figure out where I was and how to help. As soon as they could, they all called me with loving and supporting messages. However, as I was still hospitalized, that group chat (who I was not in, but a friend sent me screenshots) turned into a conversation bashing me, saying I always had a shitty personality, that I was looking for attention, that I was doing emotional blackmail and manipulation, and that it was better to just ignore me. Two friends (including my BFF for 15 years) said the meanest things, and two friends remained completely silent in the group chat. One of those who remained silent said that she needed time before she could speak to me again.

This really shocked me and saddened me. These friends were my closest friends, they knew I suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts in the past and they had always been supportive. (For the record, we are all in our late 20s/early 30s).

"I hate everyone who loves meFuck you for keeping me alive. The only reason i get up every morning is because I have people in my life who would feel like shit if I was gone. Life is a joke. There's no such thing as a ""you"". If I walk in a building with my best fit and smile I will be treated better than if I walked in looking like a regular person. Life is a competition to be the best. Back in Middle School I had the best grades in my school, never a grade below an A. Now I'm 18 and feel like a failure. My 19th Birthday is in a month and I dread it every second. I can't see myself at 19. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 15. This quarantine only made it stronger. I'm high 24/7 and even then I feel like shit. But the feeling intensifies when I'm sober. I hate myself I really do. I was spit and beat on and verbally abused as a kid at school and babysitters home. My self esteem is dependent on other people. If someone tells me my legs look weird then all I will think about the whole day and I mean it very seriously it eats me the fuck up. I might be bisexual, whenever I get gay thoughts I punch myself and get high but the thoughts come back. I might be a masochist, I have intense daydreams of being taken advantage off and being a slave to a master. I can't be like that I can't. That's not the person I want to be. Girls only care about money and fame. I already been laughed at most of my life for looking feminine and being skinny imagine when people find out I have a pegging fetish. I need to die as fast as possible. Suicide is on my mind from the second I wake up to the second I fall asleep. I don't deserve to live. I wanted to be like Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci (my idols). I am a very fast learner, extremely artistic and creative, but I hate this existence. Life is a lie. I wish I was never born. I'm forced to play the game of life all because 2 people were horny 18 years ago. I want to slit my wrist or hang myself in front of the whole world to show people what society does to people. My whole life I just wanted to be happy but the only happiness I found is in weed and right now I ran out so until I pick up some more I'll be daydreaming suicide. Goodbye

I'm worried that I'm wasting my teenage years.

My goal this year was to get a girlfriend, which was hard enough because I've never had one and COVID made it even more impossible. 

There's hardly even a girl at my school that I like. There is either the popular girls who think they're celebrities and will leave me on delivered on snap or there's girls i'm not really into. I've never even had my first kiss.

I'm not super popular and I've never been to a party.

Over quarantine I've been working on myself by losing weight and working out and changing my hairstyle and things like that.

Getting a girlfriend is the one I want so badly. I wanna be like those relationship goals videos you see on TikTok. I want to cuddle up in bed and have someone that I love and who loves me back. I feel like if I don't get a girlfriend at all in high school then it's going to be a waste of time and that i'll be way behind and missed out on so many good opportunities that come with having a girlfriend in highschool.. You might say ""oh you don't need a gf"". Well you don't NEED anything except for food and water. But i really really want a special girl, a girl that I can have a REAL relationship with in highschool. I don't want to be some loser who doesn't get his first girlfriend till he's finished high school.

"My fish played among us We started out with 12 fish and then one fish mysteriously disappeared

We ignored it bc it was just one fish

Then another one disappeared

We figured out that one of the fish was eating the other ones, hence why we couldn't find the corpses of the dead fish

Then another one disappeared

We were starting to get worried bc we didn't wanna lose all our fish, but we didn't separate the fish up to find the impostor

Then more disappeared until there were 2 left

They were around the same size so we didn't know who was the culprit. One was a black fish and one was a red fish. The red one was always faster than the black one

Then finally one day we only had one fish left

It was the black one

"Feel pretty rubbish about myself rn I'm pan/ace female in a relationship with a straight/ace male, and my sister is bi in a relationship with a bi male.



My sister is very loud and proud about her sexuality and LGBT issues, whereas her boyfriend and myself are more closeted. Nothing wrong with either of those, but sometimes she likes to throw it in your face a bit, and constantly talks about how sexy/fit/attractive girls are in front of her boyfriend, which apparently he feels bad about (and I'm sure if he was talking about dudes she'd be upset). 



She claims to understand LGBT and mental health issues with her activism, but if you mention a problem, she'll often make fun of you / make a joke which isn't funny.



Basically my town have pride flags up at the moment, and I was upset because I hadn't seen a pan or ace flag yet. I saw a NB flag today (possibly questioning if I'm NB atm but only a few people know) and it made me happy. 



We walked past and I said 'guess the flag' and she was like 'non-binary' and I was like 'yeah' all excitedly. As a joke, I pointed out the rainbow flag and asked her to guess (because everyone knows that flag) and she said 'stop trying to pretend like you're gayer than me', which really hurt. I'm not as open about my sexuality, and I've never been with another gender apart from male so it made me really upset.



We then walked past a pan flag and I freaked. I was so happy because I hadn't seen one yet! And I was saying how cool it was and she was like 'I'd call myself pan but I can't be arsed'... Like, what?? Then went to say how she can label herself what she likes. Of course she can, but it's weird that she'd say that as if being pansexual is a bad thing.



And finally, I said 'now we have to find an asexual flag', and she said 'yeah but remember asexuals don't exist'. I was like WTF, and she said it was a joke. Not very funny, is it?! See what I mean about showing how she cares for the community but then makes a remark like that? It happens constantly. Especially with my mental health triggers. 



Nothing she said today was funny. None of it. I can't believe she had the audacity to say that and invalidate both me and my boyfriend.

"I Confronted My PastSo I made a post here, a little while ago where I was on the verge of death. But last night I had the conversation I never thought I could have. Without revealing too much detail, I had a traumatic event happen to me when I was quite young which I had never been able to talk about. But last night my mum and I had heart to heart. I cried harder than I had ever cried before in my life. I told her I was sorry and she said there was nothing to be sorry for. I feel like I have had a crushing weight lifted off my soul, I just hope I can move on now from the past. I am sick of being stuck reliving old events, I have been ready to let go for so long. I just want to forget about it and move on now. This time is different, I am cutting the cord from my past and starting a brand new life.

Not sure why I am sharing here, but I don't feel suicidal anymore and I am excited about what the future holds once more.

he texted me after i made my post about sexual assault and asked me for my discord. usually, i would try to say no, but my friend had previously reminded me that not everyones bad because i dont really trust people. so why not go for it? 

he said friends and i agreed. friends. thats all. we chatted for like 5-10 minutes before he asked me my age. i said 12 after he said he was 19. he said he didnt believe me because i was ""so mature."" i said there was nothing i could do to make him believe me and he said i could send him a picture of my face. i declined and sent him a picture of a stuffed animal i had on my bed.

he asked me if i humped it which i thought was weird but maybe it was a joke? i kept repeating to myself not everyones bad. by the way, this started at 19:something. 

he said i couldve just been a weird old man then after a lot of convincing, i sent a pic of my face covered so he could see my hair. he commented on how i just got out of the shower, but it was too late to back out now. i have a fear of judgement so i couldnt just tell him to stop being weird, or stop talking to him. i couldnt ghost him because i was ghosted by my best (and only) friend and i couldnt do anything for weeks afterwards because i was so upset. also, it was too soon for me to know what would happen.

he said he thinks im cute and he wanted to see my face. no way i was doing that, right? i wouldnt give in to sending a pic of my face. he said i could blocked out my eyes and wouldnt stop. i didnt know how to block people on discord, at the time so i sent it. he said i was cute multiple times. how could i do that? that was my number one rule of the internet: no photos. i decided no more photos. 

but then he asked if i could do an egirl face. i didnt know what it was so i looked it up. it should be the first thing that shows up when you search egirl face. later, i told my friend and he said it was called a hentai face so, ew. i refused because they look like theyre having orgasms. he said just a smile. i asked him if this was sexual and he got really defensive about it. i was really uncomfortable so i decided to send it. i blocked out my eyes in every photo since the very beginning and continued to until the end. again, it took a lot of persuasion. he called me pretty. he said just do the egirl face. i didnt. how is it not sexual? i asked and he said how are selfies sexual? i still said no. 

just a photo with your tongue out, you can block your eyes. he wouldnt stop saying that. he wouldnt stop after i kept saying no. he was now begging more than asking. i think he caught on that i didnt like upsetting people and dont like people not liking me. he said it would make his day. i said i would send it if he would stop asking. he agreed and i sent it. 

from here on, im having trouble remembering the timeline of events, sorry. i do know that all of this happened.

he commented on my shirt, asking what it says. its very personal to me, so i said i made it with my friend when we had a sleepover. he said ""wow you really are 12 arent you?"" i said ""i have no reason to be lying, would i?""

he asked my to pull my shirt down more. he begged me. i said no a million times. a million. he said ""i thought you were mature"" i said i wasnt pulling my shirt down any more than it was. he said he thought i was nice. thats when i gave up. i sent it. i couldnt handle disappointing more people.

 he said to put on just a bra. i refused. i wouldnt go there, right? no way. he said people showed less on the beach. ""we're not at the beach"" i tried to reason. he said ""so?"" i said ""if its not sexual, why would you want it?"" ""because youre cute"" it didnt really answer my question. i did it. i sent a picture. i did it and i hate myself. i couldnt handle all the messages i was getting. i couldnt do it. he was begging me, calling me rude names among other things. i know i didnt have to, but i did. everything that happened was my fault. i know that.

it got worse and eventually i was topless. he was telling me to do things, exactly. ""stick your tongue out and hold your tit."" ""more light"" ""less face, more skin"" were all things he said. dont feel any pity for me, its my fault. 

here are some things he said but i dont remember when he said it but want to say. ""push your tit out your bra and smile this time"" i didnt smile. ""shhh itll be our secret. dont tell anyone!"" when i asked him why he did this to me, he said ""because im horny"" he ruined me because he was horny. im not the same person i was before he texted me. ""chill"" is what he said when i got mad at him. not like he ruined my world. not like he made me scared in my own home. not like i slept with the light on and was looking behind my shoulder while walking down my halls. not like i couldnt go to school because im so scared.  ""one more until i cum"" he said that so many times. i sent over 30 photos and he *still* didnt cum? 

i deleted him from my discord but i screenshotted a few conversations. heres one:

me: im not even a teenager

him stick your tongue out

him: u will be soon

me: im a child

him: a hot one

him: make the pic

then i sent a photo. i pretty much gave up at this point. i knew i couldnt do anything. heres another:

me: why would you make me do this?

him: how did i make you?

him: lmao

him: i didnt grab your hands

him: make you take a pic

thats the end of the screenshot. someone on reddit got involved and i gave him the guys discord. i blocked the creep. this all happened last night. my friend made me feel a lot better. i regret deleting our conversation because now i have a very little amount of evidence that anything happened. its child porn if i decide to let anyone know. if you read this, thank i guess. this took me a while to write.",,Anxious

I feel the same way I told myself I won't feel. I feel.. Suicidal, I've had a life which some of u may look at and say ""be happy"" but all my childhood I've known nothing but physical abuse. It's stopped now cause now my parents can't actually hurt me (I mean I'm 16, I can beat the shit out of them) but ever since 8 grade the abuse lifted and I've had less violent memories? I feel like shit most of the time, worthless, hidden, scared. I feel like one single leaf in a bouquet of beautiful flowers. I'm bi and if anyone were to know, I'd be tortured, raped and arrested. The police would help torture me. They may say ""free speech"" but let's just say I'm not convinced. They hunt people like me.


I don't know if walking down this road is what I have to do.. Maybe I'll just skip to the end of the road. I have only one childhood (friend)? But he doesn't like me. I have zero friends in general. My mother doesn't believe that mental health is a thing and she can't tell why I don't get out of bed, she can't tell why I'm angry waking up. I don't have a life expectancy farther than 18 years old.


I'm stuck in this shit hole, it's so bad, so bad. I feel like crying most of the time but I've become so devoid of emotions that I can't even cry when I want to. I feel like I'm going insane. My mom and dad fight every day, all day. They make me so angry it makes me want to repay the physical abuse they did. It makes me want to hurt them. They don't shut up.


Only one thing loves me unconditionally and That's my pet bird. I don't remember the last time my mother or father hugged me or said ""I love you"" unconditionally. I don't  remember  the last time any one did, really.


It hurts so much, seeing all these posts saying ""I got a girlfriend/boyfriend!!"" or ""she said yes!!!"". I hate myself for being imperfect, for being born into this world. I can't love a boy or a girl. I can't have a girlfriend or a boyfriend if I do they'll kill me. I'd be just one more bastard sinner, right.

You know, I wish I was able to buy into spirituality, religion, the afterlife, the supernatural, etc because I believe having some sort of faith would make dealing with misery and other sufferings easier. Religious people usually have faith in their identities as they believe that there is a higher force dictating their life with rules and dogma on the ""right"" way to live. Have someone pull the strings for you, if you will. I once heard this Buddhist quote, ""The only suffering is the mind's addiction to identity."" True, if only you could control the way you were perceived. I feel something's lost, and nothing is gained in living every day. The absence of life creates unbearable pain. I will never be a normal person. I simply don't understand anything. I don't have this natural ability that people seem to possess.

Really just a single day, but there was nothing.  That's what I was hoping for all year but not a single thing. Not a single thing changed. Nothing. Inside my own self-pity, I'll swim around forever. Every day is the exact same. Life is all an endless cycle with all the days blended together. Nobody sees me, I mean literally, no one sees me. I wish I could make it so nobody has to see me ever again. I'm stuck in this existence. I'm stuck to face the same day every day. To see myself go through the motions. I must cooperate with a script written by a tentative universe that I got to skim over once while everyone else can read it every day. Life is hell on earth with pain being the only constant. I want to be transcendent. But Nothing, it will always be nothing. Everything is nothing. All pretend for pity. Fix me. If only we were actually all the same. What a shame we're not. My day won't ever come. The common denominator is nothing. That's why I'm leaving. That's why I want to walk out of life's open door. I just wanted one friend. Really how hard is that? There are no options right now but soon I hope. That's all I can do. When I'm in the same life next year then it's all a lie for me and me only I guess.

Phone Guy: If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right?
Mark: Okay!
Phone Guy: Okay.
Mark: Okay...
Phone Guy: So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit.
Mark: No way...
Phone Guy: Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night.
Mark: (Scared laughing)
Phone Guy: Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long.
Mark: Ugh...
Phone Guy: Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87.
Mark: THE BITE?!
Phone Guy: Yeah.
Mark: What bite!?
Phone Guy: I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?
Mark: WHY?!
Phone Guy: Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person.
Mark: Oh, OH!
Phone Guy: They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to... forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit.
Mark: Oh, I get it.
Phone Guy: Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices...
Mark: Uh-huh.
Phone Guy: ...especially around the facial area.
Mark: Uh-huh.
Phone Guy: So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...
Mark: Yeah!
Phone Guy: ...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.
Mark: Ugh! Oh, why... What happend?
Phone Guy: Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary.
Mark: THAT'S NOT GOOD...
Phone Guy: Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.

Mark: GOOD NIGHT?!

I don't know if it's good that you're staring at me! Oh my god. I thought it was weird that it couldn't move, but this is totally different... than any horror game I've ever played. So what you gotta do in case you not getting it is you gotta watch the cameras to make sure they don't come by- You got a little much power- Is he still there? Hi, you're still there. Wait a minute, what, DID YOU MOVE?! Okay, you didn't move. You don't move neither... You don't moving nothing... If I see you moving... I don't wanna see anything...Oh-oh-oh MY GOD! THIS'S TERRIFYING! Why do I leave doors so open, why isn't there enough power-

They're gonna pop out at me! Oh, god, he's gone. Hi. Okay. You just gonna alternate between the two places, it's totally fine. And your friends, they ain't moving. They're not moving, are they? I see where I am. You're not near me. So, that's good. Just gonna periodically check... How much long do I need- I need last to 6 a.m. Oh god, am I gonna have enough power? If I run out of power thy'll able to get me! Oh god... You stay right there! Why am I still using some power? O-oh god... Seriously, I what... this like... this like... bad! You're still there, okay.

Phone Guy: Uhh, Hello? Hello? Uh, well, if you're hearing this and you made it to day two, uh, congrats!
Mark: (laughs in panic)
Phone Guy: I-I won't talk quite as long this time since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses.
Mark: What?
Phone Guy: Uhh, it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk just to make sure everyone's in their proper place.
Bonnie is in Dining Area 
Mark: No.
Phone Guy: You know... Uh... Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come off stage very often. I heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so, hey, I guess that's one more reason not to run out of power, right?
Mark: (laughs in panic)
Phone Guy: I-I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights. There are blind spots in your camera views, and those blind spots happen to be right outside of your doors. So if-if you can’t find something, or someone, on your cameras...
Bonnie is in the West Hall 
Mark: Ugh-h!
Phone Guy: ...be sure to check the door lights. Uh, you might only have a few seconds to react... Uh, not that you would be in any danger, of course. I'm not implying that.
Mark: Of course!
Phone Guy: Also, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time. The character in there seems unique in that he becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of time. I guess he doesn't like being watched.
Bonnie is in W. Hall Corner 
Mark: UGH-GH! UHH!
Phone Guy: I don't know. Anyway, I'm sure you have everything under control! Uh, talk to you soon.

They said no, it wasn't but I felt they were wrong because if I couldn't break any bricks, then they MUST be unbreakable! (Well that and because I was like 5 I didn't know any better lol) 

But my parents decided to show me proof that bricks weren't all that strong by having me watch a video of a tsunami tearing apart buildings, most of which were probably constructed with bricks. I was so shocked and dumbfounded when I saw that, that I became VERY afraid of water to the point where I thought that the littlest bit could make a tsunami and it made me scared to bathe because I thought that I would drown due to a tsunami forming in the tub. 

This fear of water/bathing stuck with me for a looonngg time afterwards, but eventually after I grew older I stopped fearing water and baths and now interact with both with no fear at all whatsoever.",,Anxious

Petrified and having no supportI'm paranoid someone else is in the house with me even though the only other person here is my mom.  I talked to my mom about needing to go inpatient and she complely blew me off.  I just called the inpatient unit to talk to someone for figuring out what to do with my paranoia.  I know I'm a paranoid schizophrenic but still I feel so alone and need someone right now to have some sort of contact with.  The inpatient I it said if I started feeling suicidal to go to the ER even though I SAID I wasn't suicidal.  She mentioned to me about trying my coping skills but those failed on me.  The person I talked to at the inpatient unit when I was asked my name she recognized who I was.  I'm thinking that I will have to give a who tells for my mom to bring me in.  Please someone help me I implore you.  Night time is the worst for me.  I was so paranoid I called the police on Friday to check the place out.

"i live in my headim a 15 year old tranny faggot with a bad case of the ""dumb crisis"", using my ""main"" because i need to get over myself and my fears because dumb, talk about that in the future if i'm here just start the damn post please thanks just stop

i live in my head, in my own delusion and it hurts because i know it'll never be real and the people who i love there arent real. i know that my asshole of lovable friends won't be real and anything i we do together isn't real.

like i damn pretend to hang out with them or we actually go out and just walk and talk together because we're chill, we fucking cosplay and make jokes about weird stuff on the internet, everyone has their own personality and life and understanding of things. like i can just talk to them and they're real but they're not and i want to stop so bad

the stuff i do with those friends is then posted online because ""haha funneh"" and it gets made into compilations (e.g. \[someone's\] funniest moments) so i get the excuse of thinking about specific scenes, i run around making jokes to myself and i laugh at myself to simulate someone else. i play games with myself but pretend there's a player 2 and we're having fun together. i scream and choke/cough so much alone because i run out of breath trying to pace and talk at the same time. it's not helped by the fact i'm borderline anorexic.

i made up someone to love me just because i can't stop wanting to be hugged by someone, i just want tell someone i love them and hear it back. i hug myself to try and feel like it's real but it never will be. i lie in bed and just dream of someone cuddling me and just saying ""it's going to be okay, I'M here for you"" but you're not and never will be. you'll never be real and i'll never hug you, you'll never wipe away my stupid tears and call me a dummy for crying and then proceed to make fun of me for laughs and make those tears go away.

i feel like if i die then i can just live there and be free of my loop, and by loop i literally pace in the same spot every single day thinking about this fantasy of a life, i feel like i can't get across to my psychiatrist of how toxic my mental state is, i feel like i can't get anything across without breaking into tears. even when someone texts me and i feel like there ""tone"" is unusual/not the same i say sorry. i say sorry for everything because i can't afford to lose the real connections i some how made, i don't know how to make new ones because i'm to much of a pussy to talk first because i feel like existing is bothering people. i refuse to call 000 (911) because i don't think i'm worth their time. 

i want to die so bad because i feel like then i can get out of this lonely place i'm in. 2020 is my last year to find a purpose outside of my head but so far i've got nothing. i have no one who would care if i was gone. family no, real friends, no, i just sit on the sidelines most of the time. but they still say they care about me but for some reason i believe in the friends in my head so much more. i believe that one day my life will be like just how it is in my thoughts. i don't want to be famous, i just want to be loved by someone and make jokes

i would talk about everything in my world, real and fake but if i don't finish something, i'll never post this and never get help and i just want to stop pretending and face the facts that i just have to deal with what i have. i will never have friends who will ever do anything like that, i'll never be an animator and i'll never be happy as i was in my thoughts

i just need to hit post and stop thinking, i want to be dead, i'm to scared even to post this but i need someone/anyone real to hear it and just slap me. it's to the point where i complain about this way of thinking to the fake people i'm thinking of. i'm worried i'll fully forget whats real and whats fake, i have already began getting confused, i just dont want it to get to the point where i believe they are real and i get put on a news paper for everyone to go ""glad i'm not that guy"" and live in their real world

i just want a purpose, a reason to keep putting up with this, just an ending

i feel like i'll have to give myself my own ending, my death is something that i can control and it's gotten to me. i could end it all if i wanted but paranoia hits hard, and so can my anti depressents. i feel like they don't do anything, so honestly i just should lie to myself

My aunt who was like a best friend died when I was 6 then one of my dogs that I loved so dearly died when I was 9. I feel like their deaths are my fault because I made her stay home during the winter instead of going to Texas. I didn't notice the signs that my dog wasn't ok. I've always carried this guilt with me and it's developed into my depression. Growing up I was always bullied and once middle school hit me harder.  My anger worsened I couldn't play hockey because I got thrown off of a team. I'm the reason why everything in the world goes wrong. If I was dead the world would be a better place. I would always fake being happy because I never wanted people to worry about me. I hid scars and my arms in hoodie for a long time.

"WorthlessI 30 last month.

 I look at my sisters, and feel inadequate. Tturnedhey've all accomplished great things. Me? Nothing. Not a damn thing. Even my sister who has neglected her children and abandoned them gets praise from my family for her intelligence (she went through undergrad and law school on full ride scholarships) and her skill in crochet (award winning).

 I'm just a vet tech. I might feel good sometimes about rescuing animals, rehabbing them, finding them homes. All I get is criticism from my family. ""ANOTHER animal?"" Still treated as a ten year old. I have no discernable skills. Nothing I can show and say,  ""Hey, look at this great thing I can do!"" 

My boyfriend, he doesn't love me in the way a boyfriend should love his girlfriend. I am too broke to move out. Sometimes I think he knows that and that's why I'm still here. 

I think people just feel sorry for me sometimes because I have illnesses and injuries that prevent me from doing things other people can do. Things I love to do. I don't want that to be who I am. I want people to be PROUD of me. I want to LOVE life, and I just don't. 

I have no friends. No hopes anymore. Everything I wanted to achieve dashed by bad lungs and chronic pain. 

I can't even cry. Oh how I wish I could. 

I feel sick. What's the point anymore. Why do I keep going. Every day, that question looms over me like a monster, getting closer and closer to me. I can barely get it out of my mind now. I'm a waste of space. My days off I've started spending laying in bed, doing nothing, because I just don't have the will or the energy to do anything else. 

Therapy hasn't helped. I stopped going. I felt like my psychologist felt the same way about me... that I'm useless.

I have borderline personality disorder and get called “weird, crazy, clingy, psycho, etc” all of the fucking time. I have never set out to intentionally hurt anymore. I have such a kind heart. I truly don’t understand what I do to push EVERYONE away. I’m in a stare of confusion constantly. 

I just moved to WA and have truly never felt so pathetic. I thought coming here would change everything, but this horrible side of me followed.

"Teachers NEED to check for 504 plans Ok. to start off, I have an auditory processing disorder, it makes it harder for me to understand speech and verbalize my own thoughts, I have also been diagnosed with bad social anxiety /panic disorder(another type of anxiety). So with these, I set up a 504 plan(a certain set of guidelines to make any classroom comfortable and easy to learn in) that tells the teachers to either give me a notice/warning that they will be asking me a question or to give me extra time to answer a spoken question. Also, they were told to provide me with slide shows or articles that contain all of the information in the lessons, and that I wouldn't need to stay in pace with the whole class but I still needed to finish reading the slides or article by the end of class. finally, they were told to not question me as much or as frequently as other students, because it occasionally gives me panic/anxiety attacks. The key thing is when I get nervous I will smile or laugh/giggle, IDK why but I guess a coping mechanism.

&amp;#x200B;

This was all in my history class(My Teacher is a very high temper person)

I will use ""---"" for words I didn't understand.

\*The teacher was calling on random people\*

&amp;#x200B;

Teacher: Jett --- comes after --- Financial --- corruption.

Me: sorry, I didn't understand what you asked.

Teacher \*in annoyed voice\* what comes after the financial and government corruption.

Me \*going though the slides she provided, with a big smile on my face\*: what slide would this be on?

Teacher \*yelling in the video call\*: It's --- 3, If you were --- you would --- answer!

Me \*having a small panic attack, and the same smile\*: I'm sorry, I couldn't understand you?

Teacher \*yelling at me in front of the whole video call\*: if you were paying attention you would know the answer and be able to answer me.

Me \*giggling, and my heart rate rising\*: I'm sorry I can't answer the question rn.

Teacher \*in annoyed voice\* it was ---.

\*2 or 3 minutes pass\*

Teacher \*in annoyed voice\*: you guys need to pay attention isn't that right Jett.

Me \*still smiling with my adrenalin pumping\*: I'm sorry mam, I was confused, and I couldn't understand you.

Teacher \*yelling\*: If you were paying attention you wouldn't be --- or ---, and you smiling is very rude and disrespectful.

Me \*not able to think or say words, still smiling\*: I.. um.. I.

Teacher \*yelling\*: YOU KNOW WHAT, leave. get out of this call I will be emailing your parents!

Me \*having a full-blown panic attack not able to understand words, just heavy breathing, and laughter\*: Ok, sorry. \*Leaves call\*

\*so I go downstairs and tell my mom about the situation\*

Mom: it's ok as long as your grade isn't affected I'm fine.

\*about 3 or 4 hours later after I calmed down, the teacher sent my dad an email telling him ""I was off task, and how I wasn't paying attention, and how she could see my screen with GoGuardian"" (an app for school Chromebooks that monitor and control the Chromebooks to some extent, keep in a note it does not work on a personal Windows 10 computers.)\*

Me \*to my dad\*: I wasn't off task. Second I was a little behind the class and I didn't know where they were. Third, it's not possible for her to see my screen, I'm on my personal pc with no extra school extensions or programs.

"Anyone else have such a boring life you don’t even know why you bother?(I should mention I’m a teenager, so I rely on my parents a fair amount) My life is packed full of family drama and just being by myself. Every month feels so long while living through it and then when I look back it seems like it zipped by. I’m realizing that’s literally because I have done nothing note worthy to remember the month by. I constantly find myself just waiting for the day to end because I have nothing to do, get ready for or friends to talk to. I’ve tried finding natural ways to have your brain release dopamine and serotonin, for example I work out a lot but it doesn’t make me feel any better. I used to have violin lessons, so I could prepare for that but we can’t afford to take them anymore. I’m supposed to start basketball next month but my dad is insisting my mom takes me to get the required physical and my mom can’t afford to take me and insists my dad should do it. We need it in 4 days. The same thing is happening with theatre, which is my number one passion in life. I want to do this musical in January of 2020 but my mom can’t afford it and my dad is insisting she pays it. I would try to at least pay for half of it but I have no money from paying for activities last year/the beginning of this one. 

And maybe that wouldn’t be so bad if I had a friend or s/o. But I don’t. When I say I have no friends I genuinely mean it. The only place I ever had friends was at theatre, and my parents don’t wanna pay for any singing or acting coaches or drive me to auditions or anything. 

My birthday was two months ago and it was the god damn worst. No one remembered, we didn’t do anything. My brother told someone at school who told my science teacher and she sung happy birthday to me first period. That’s as far as any celebration or recognition of it happening went. Because I do nothing I have time to think this kinda stuff over, like why do people not have friends? Normally there either a shit person, too quiet, or too annoying. I’m not sure which category I’ve fallen into but all of it just makes me wanna take a knife to the throat. I own knives, and I’ve thought about this stuff for years but never actually had the balls do go through with it. Now we’re here. I just got back from a run and feel even worse than I did before.

"How to stop a bad person Hey kids, pedophiles are annoying, so to make sure they keep to their own business you need to scare the shit out of them. Here's how:

If someone asks for a phone number do a weird number like 69 or 666, even better if you give them the emergency number if you are in a different country from them.  


Then make up a fake address from some meme or something like globglobglobgalab avenue.  


Then if they ask for pictures SPAM THEM WITH DISSECTION/GORE/NSFW IMAGES until they cry stop  


If they dox you, dox them back.  


If they call you put on some disturbing audio like screams or menacing sounds.

"Had to move this post from /Anxiety to /SuicideWatchOver time I've gotten to where I can handle most issues I come across constructively. Not necessarily perfectly, but I can see the problem, see how I'm feeling about it, accept those feelings and find an appropriate action if necessary.

I can't seem to do this when I think about how I relate with other people. I'm successful socially, and I don't avoid social situations as far as I can tell, but I often feel that I am awkward, unsuccessful and on the outside of things (I depersonalize my interactions both at the time and when I recall them.) When I try to address these thoughts, rather than establishing that it's at least somewhat inaccurate and fixable, I end up spiraling into depression until I can pass out for the night.

For instance tonight I tried to post to the anxiety subreddit and ask if what I was experiencing was typical of a social anxiety issue. Instead I ended up curled up in my bed, at one point beating my wrists together, wanting desperately to find a lighter and burn myself, and in lieu of that find a cliff and a gun, stand with my back to the fall, put the gun in my mouth and let the propulsion throw me off the cliff so that I'd be sure to die.

I'm pretty sure I don't want to die, and I don't want to hurt myself because I know that doesn't actually help me. But if I can't even address the issue in privacy without creating a detailed suicide plan, talking to someone else (interacting with them in a very vulnerable way) about it would probably be a billion times worse, to a point where thoughts might even become actions. I really don't know, because I can't get close enough to give it any thought. What do I do?

"Modern feminism be like Feminism means equality and as a feminist the world needs feminism and not equality. The only problem is that we feminists can't agree what feminism virtually is, conflicts we solve by not bringing them up. The most important thing is that we always speak from the perspective that's most advantageous for women in each case

I think equality is that sex doesn't matter, but at the same time I require more high position jobs for women based on their sex

I think sex segregation should be dismantled, but at the same time I support gender distribution in every society's section

I think sex is just external variable that doesn't have a real effect on an individuals attributes, but at the same time I say that it's discrimination against women to valuebso to speak masculine attributes instead of feminine attributes

Men are prejudiced againt men, but at the same time I say that feminism doesn't prejudice men

I think that feminism doesn't hate men, but at the same time I think that high position policy-makers' being male is a problem

You shouldn't discriminate based on external features, but at the same time I say that straight white men can't speak for minorities

I think that stereotyping is always wrong, but at the same time I say that straight white males are in principle always in better position

I think men are favored in recruitment, but at the same time I say that women do the same job for cheaper

I think multiculturality should be supported, but at the same time I require giving up genders roles

I think we should value individual's experiences, except when they are against feminist worldview

Western society has sexualised the female body, but ath the same time I highlight that people sexual preferences cam't be infuenced

I think everyone can freely implement their sexuality but at tge same time I criticize women in commercials

I think women experience unrealistic ideal bodies as desirable, but at the same time I think that women experiencebunrealistic ideal bodies as women degrading

The image of woman created by tge media is too one-sided, but at the same I think that the image of woman created by the media places conflicting demands

I think women have full right to choose about their sex life, but at the same time I convey that porn degrades women

I think everyone should be able to freely enjoy their own sexuality, but at the same time I think men shouldn't rate women's looks

I think that women are as sexually willing as men, but at the same time I say sexual allusion and harassment focus on particularly from men to women

I think women are equally as strong and independent as men and don't need special protection, but at the same time I say that moving at night is especially dangerous for women

I think that the importance of sex should be reduced, but at the same time I say that attention must be paid to the number of female victims in cases that are suffered from regardless of gender

I think women are have as good sense of humor as men, but at the same time I emphasize that women stereotypes shouldn't be jokes about

I think everyone should have the same rights, but at the same time I accept racist jokes only from black people and sexist jokes only from women

I think that terms referring to gender should be changed to gender neutral, but at the same time I think the term ""feminism"" is suitable for promoting equality between women and men

I think feminism's extreme forms don't represent feminism, but at the same time I let you know that whoring women represents anfifeminism

I think that feminism is very self-critical ideology, but at the same time argue that opponents of feminism just don't know what they're talking about and feminism is needed as long as feminism is opposed",,Stressed

"On hold with the suicide hotline lmaoBeen calling for the past hour, tried two different hotlines- the regular suicide hotline and the sexual assault survivors one. None of the people are remotely helpful. The people on the sexual assault survivor line just read off a script, ""oh you were abused? Well, here's the crime victim's assistants center."" and then they wait patiently for me to hang up, their job clearly over. 

The regular hotline people are even worse. They all just sound bored. I tell one guy I was abused, there's a long pause, he says ""you were abused huh"" and then repeats it again after a few moments. I apologize and say I'm wasting his time, he doesn't say anything for another ten seconds and it gets so awkward I hang up.

Nothing really works, idk anymore. I don't actively want to kill myself necessarily, but fighting my depression and occasional vaugely suicidal thoughts gets so god damn tiring. I go to therapy, but even after switching therapists I make no progress. They're the only 2 free ones I can get, so I got no options there. I can't keep bothering my friends too often, but they don't know what to say either. Hotlines are worthless, I've called in the past and it's the same deal. Once someone even called the cops on me, which was horrifying and gave me trust issues. 

I don't know where else I could turn. It's just so frustrating. posting on here is pointless too. I do it all the time and it's not helpful and no one is even gonna respond at 2AM anyway, but I just gotta get it off my chest I guess.

Don't tell me you want to talk over PMs if you're just gonna stop responding. I'm not sure what secret thrill some people get about pretending they want to help suicidal people, but I'm not falling for it anymore.

"My girlfriend told me last night she wants to kill herself. What can I do?My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly 2 years. We've been through hell and back together, but never left each other's side. She's been dealing with depression and anxiety for over 5 years, and I gave my best all this time we've been together to help her feel better. We live in different cities, but we manage to see each other 2\-3 times during weekdays and we spend the entire weekend together. I try to take her to the movies, or to some restaurant every now and then, but almost always she says she's not in the mood. We stay home and watch something on Netflix, eat popcorn and talk for hours, and it's always an awesome day when I get to spend it with her. 

Her father died when she was 2yo, her mother neglected and left her to live with her grandparents for over 10 years. She has a younger sister, who she raised since she was 7. She had problems with past relationships and with her own family involving physical violence, but luckly not sexual. As far as I know, she used to cut herself for years before we met and tried to kill herself a couple of times. 

Her Grandfather, who raised her and who she loved more than anything died a few months before we met, and she cries every week and talks about how much she misses him, and how much he meant to her. Without him, she feels alone in a family that hates her. She always says that she is alone, and when I question her about if she feels alone with me, the answer is always the same. ""It doens't include you."" I started to feel like it does several months ago. 

Her jobs requires her to be up and ready at 4h30 AM, talk to hundreds of angry strangers for hours and work at crazy hours on weekends. She told me several times over the past year \(since she's been working there\) that she's extremely tired. Of life, of family, of work, and that the only thing keeping her alive was me. We've had our fair share of problems, but nothing serious and we haven't fought for weeks. Out of nowhere, yesterday night, she asked if she could share something with me. 

""I'm think about suicide again. It has been so long since it's been this strong within me. I force myself away from those thoughts, but when I realise, I'm there again. I feel tired of everything and all the time. I know that there is something wrong with me, but I can't take it out. I don't even know who I am.""

"It's like 6 AM where i live and i just woke up because of sleep paralysis I hate that shit. I've had a lot of those before so i'm kinda ""used"" to it, but it is, still, a terrifying experience.

And now that i woke up already and have nothing to do, i'm just going to tell what happened that probably caused it.

I'm at my grandma's farm giving support and company to her and my father, since my grandpa died a few days ago.

I slept on the couch (because it's big and the only place that i could sleep without my back hurting for the next 2 days) and woke up at 3 AM to get a cup of water, hearing a few weird noises but hey, i'm on a farm right? So i go back to sleep.

I know it's irrational, but the thing is, i'm a bit anxious, and a bit paranoid, so those noises probably increased the chances of the event occurring.

I had a lucid dream, one thing that i love and hate at the same time, love because, well, it's a lucid dream, freedom, after all, but hate because it lasts 2 minutes and then it goes all wrong.

With ""goes all wrong"" i mean that most of the times i have a lucid dream, it suddenly turns into a fucking horror movie from one second to another.

In the dream, i'm at my street, just walking peacefully, i look at the alley on my right and there is a figure, just standing there, menacingly, it was fucking terrifying, it was tall, like 8-10 ft, and i could barely see it because of the dark, but still, for some reason, terrifying, i ran to the nearest door and tried to open it.

And then it happens. I wake up, but can't say anything, can't move, only see, amazing. But as i said before, i had a lot of those already, so it lasted like 10-15 seconds and then i actually woke up, cold like ice, but woke up.

TL;DR: heard weird noises at 3 AM and had a lucid dream, wich probably caused the sleep paralysis, and now i'm here",,Anxious

"Accomplice or accessory to sexual assault by deception when I was 16. I'm now 29 and have been suicidal on and off since then and have been spiraling but don't know the best way forward.I've been thinking about this for almost half of my life but have never written it down. I'll break it into a few parts. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--What happened--

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16 and still completely inexperienced with sex and relationships i was at a bush/forest party where everyone was camping for the night. There was a girl there who was a little older than me and was sexually adventurous and enjoyed trying to flirt and have sex with inexperienced guys. She was interested in me and I didnt know what to do. At this party she invited me into a tent with a few other guys in it where some group sex was going to take place. I agreed to go even though I was scared and uncomfortable. I lost my nerve and left the tent without participating and my friends and I decided to ""swap me out"" with another guy. So we traded shirts. This other guy went into the tent and received a brief handjob and was found out and she kicked him out of the tent. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt terrible after when i realized who i actually was if i was capable of that. I didn't do it out of any form of lust or sexual desire just pure fear of being seen as a coward or pathetic virgin. I could give you all sorts of excuses about how this behavior was ""normal"" in my friend group and all the despicable shit my friends did, or how i saw it as a comedy bit it movies, but none of that changes what I did. 

She knows what I did but i never talked to her about it. Ive talked to her a handful of times since then but have never apologized. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--Current problem --

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that what i did was illegal and that it was a terrible thing to do but i cant change what i've done.  Ive hurt someone that was nice enough to be attracted to me, and there's nothing I can do to erase my actions. I considered suicide multiple times and engaged in reckless behavior on motorcycles and at work hoping to get into accidents. I walked bridges and fantasized about driving my car into things. The reason I never went through with it is part cowardice and part fear of what would happen to my family if I committed suicide. 

My mom is chronically depressed and turns out was abused as a child and has told me since, that her biggest fear is that she'd pass on her depression to me and my brother.  We've had a few suicides in the family i've seen how they aren't really clean ends to things.

 I'm also worried how she'd take her son becoming a perpetrator of sexual crimes given her history. I'm trying to be the best person i can be, I don't hang around with any of those people anymore, and have never been involved in anything else remotely similar to this, but it doesn't help me get out of these cycles of guilt and I don't know if it should. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 5 or 6 years i get caught in loops trying to think of a path forward that hurts the least amount of people.  

&amp;#x200B;

Path 1. 

I commit suicide.  

This proves that I feel remorse and decreases the chances my family finds out which would hurt especially my mother and could possibly end her life which would hurt the family, all of whom shouldn't be responsible for my actions.

&amp;#x200B;

Path 2. 

I apologize to the girl. 

Ive considered this for a long time but have read and think i agree with that the victims of sexual assault don't like to be bothered, especially if i have my own motivations for an apology. I'm also worried that this might cause her to out me to my family which is completely within her right. But i struggle with thinking about the pain in my family that would cause and how it still wouldn't change what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Path 3. 

My family eventually finds out. 

This is fairly possible but if my family found out I don't think i could bear to stay alive. which would mean my mom might commit suicide and family would be hurt even more than Path 1 

&amp;#x200B;

Path 4. 

 No one ever finds out. 

This seems possible. But i dont think I'd be able to live in this state indefinitely. At some point if something doesnt happen I wont be able to take it anymore. Another problem with this path is I dont know if i can live my life alone with this guilt. I've had a couple serious relationships but I start getting ashamed and panicky when they progress because i think i dont deserve to have them. And even if someone could accept what ive done, how could i raise kids without being a hypocrite?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I just keep getting stuck in these loops, and I think i deserve it. But i don't know what option will cause the least misery to the people around me. Should i just try to bear down and live a solitary life so that i don't have to put my family through any more suicides and hope that they never find out? Or should I just end it now?",,Depressed

"Should I move out? I’m 18 years old and starting university next month. I’m currently planning to commute around an hour there and an hour back daily, but I’m thinking of moving out now.

My parents have become complete assholes since I hit 18. I’ve never been caught doing anything super stupid or even typical teenager shit like smoking pot. They have no reason to be suspicious of me. They tell me I shouldn’t go out with friends I’ve made in the past few months because “they might be bad people”. I don’t need you to judge people for me, I can do it my fucking self. I have a curfew of 9PM which is obviously pathetic and they try to guilt me be sarcastically saying things like “you turned 18 and now you want to act like a grown man?”. “You’ve changed” is another favourite of theirs, as if they expected me to never grow beyond the fragile pre-teen they took advantage of.

I literally am an adult so please just leave me the fuck alone.

We don’t have the best relationship but I don’t know whether I should move out because I don’t want to damage our relationship beyond how damaged it already is.

I could pack up my stuff and leave tomorrow without saying anything, but I’m very afraid of ruining any relationship we still have left. Just to add to this, they’ve stopped me from taking a student loan for living costs (I’m taking the minimum without them knowing which is literally only 3k a year and not enough to live on) because anything above the amount I’m going to get needs proof of their financial information and I can’t get that without them knowing. They’ve promised me that they are going to support me themselves and give me whatever money I need, but I’m realising now that it’s probably a ploy to have me under their control since if I can’t live without their money I wouldn’t be able to leave them and they would have more control over my life in general.

"The Bible is immoral for condoning and encouraging slavery. To start off I totally understand that we are applying today’s moral standards to an ancient text. With that being said the Bible considers itself the “word of God”. I understand there is a spectrum for Christianity and some believers don’t think the Bible is inerrant or even the word of God. This post is directed at fundamentalists.

The Bible has so many passages that directly encourage and endorses slavery. Here are some of the most horrible and morally reprehensible verses that I know of (but there are dozens more).

“However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.” (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)

I’m sorry but buying and selling humans like livestock is evil. An all knowing God should know better. We are more moral that this evil “God”.

“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.’  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.” (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)

Ah yes, slavey by keeping somebody’s family hostage. Sounds very John 3:16 of God here...

“When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.”(Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)

Beating a slave is only ok if they survive the beating? Pure evil here. Again, we are more moral than this God.

“Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.” (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)

This little gem is for those of you that think it was only the Old Testament that was immoral and outdated. There are dozens of these “obey your master” verses. No you shouldn’t obey your master, you shouldn’t have a master in the first place.

“The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  “But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given.” (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)

This one is for those of you that think it wasn’t “God” making these evil commands...

To finish my argument. I think it’s totally valid to apply today’s morals to a 2,000 year old text if Christians still use this book to morally bludgeon the rest of the world with. Maybe Christians should take some time to actually read the Bible before telling others how to behave. Considering their holy book literally allows and encourages slavery to continue. So much for being a holy and perfect book.

"Should I date my friend? (Long sorry) Omg I'm overwhelmed right now. She always kinda said she was straight but we always flirted playfully. We have some weird stories, I kissed her once randomly and she told me a few months later that she has a crush on me, but I was dating another girl back then. Well now we kinda sent each other those really flirty wholesome memes and she sent one that was like ""I have romantic feelings for you but I'm too shy to tell you"". Well however I asked her out on a Picknick date like the typical cottage core bisexual I am and she agreed. 

However I'm getting kinda worried. I have plans for my future with moving away etc and she's also one of my two best friends. I don't wanna lose her by messing up. But yeah, I definitely am in love with her and right now I would give everything to be cuddling with her. What do you think?",,Anxious
"Live in fear or stagnate. How is there any other way?I've spent so much of my life working hard to get ahead. I put so much effort into my field of work to the point it took over my life. I tried to enjoy it along the way but i always would isolate.

When I was young my father would beat me quite a bit with a belt. Sometimes he would leave me to ""stand in the corner"" facing it for hours until dinner. Or he would as a punishment give me the cold shoulder for months. As time went on I would isolate more and more on my computer out of fear of my father but also general anxiety around people. We moved around a lot as a family. One of the houses I lived in I had a small one bedroom upstairs and everyone else was downstairs and I liked it because I could be alone and away from him. 

I have lost so much time and energy towards life throughout the years. There was so much work done and squandered and nothing really gained. There is not much to be happy for anymore to me. I have no friends, no life, I live with my mom and a couple manipulative and abusive people. 

I have been fired from jobs, worked hard on faith for years for lower pay to see things never reach fruition. There has been so much energy I have put in on faith and trust that it will eventually pay off and now at 28 I feel it really hasnt at all. There is nothing in this world that makes me happy anymore. Even alcohol which I've had some great and bad times with in the past doesn't do it for me. My depression if that is even what this is has been with me as long as I can remember and nothing ever changes. The more effort I put into things the more I am dissapointed it doesn't work out. 

Im wondering what is the point. It seems nothing is really gained from trying but stagnation and waiting to die isn't really worth it either. Whats going to change things around if everything is meaningless? I've felt alone for most of my life even when around people and know I am not very up there on the looks. As a man I have been invisible for just about forever and nothing seems to be going to change any time soon. Im done trying to make up for lost time or put my best foot forward.

"My opinion on reddit I found out about reddit in a PewDiePie video. I thought it sounded cool, so I downloaded it. I had never had social media up until that point, so this was an interesting occasion. At first I was confused. It seemed like you could look up anything and there would be a subreddit on it. I thought social media was somethings that everyone had to have the same opinion. But as time went on, it because clear. There are many different people on the internet, so there needs to be a place where people an opinion can talk to people with the same opinion without being ridiculed by people with different opinions.  Most social media apps only have a like situation, but reddit allows you to say ""hey, I don't like that"" without having to comment under the post. In real life, I don't have many friends, but on reddit, social popularity doesn't matter. We're all just a group of outcasts who come together to make a community of wonderful people who can share their things that they would never say in real life. Don't be afraid to be yourself. We're all beautiful in our own way. Share your opinion, and if we get downvoted, than we must accept that some people don't have the same ideas as us.

"Hello my name is Andrew and I am recovering from an eating disorder I’m 13 and developed an eating disorder around April and May. I lost a lot of weight since then and I thought I was “bettering myself”. My mom and family first noticed my weight lost in June and I thought they were kidding. I saw no difference in my body. In July I started to notice. 

I drank towards the end of July (first time drinking) and my mom took me to the hospital. My mom figured out I was self harming and was getting me help a few days earlier so that is what saved me from her getting more mad. Why am I telling you this? Well when drunk I told her about my eating habits. 

So I took a helicopter to Children’s Hospital because my heart rate was slowing. All I remember is telling my mom all my secrets in the car ride to the hospital and then waking up in the helicopter already landed. I pissed myself... twice. I was hospitalized for 5 and half days. Now I got out of the hospital and I’m recovering and I have been almost been doing perfect.

Except a few mental breakdowns and a lot of crying. I am supposed to be stopping self harming but that isn’t happening so well. I feel on edge all day everyday. I feel trapped I don’t want to eat but I do. I feel so obese, but logically that can’t be true now that I am at a healthy weight. And thoughts about starving myself by throwing out food secretly and lying to my mom are becoming stronger and stronger. 

I wanna break from my diet plan by my dietitian and not eat. That’s why I need some help.

"I just don't see another option.I'm about to turn 32, and in my family business where I'm not growing, not even making that much. My wage is barely above poverty level right now. My family has encouraged me to go out and do my own thing and they would support me financially. I feel like a failure because of this. I thought I should be at least married or have a stable job where I'm growing and somewhat content by this age. Instead, I'm in a studio apartment with little to no friends (certainly no one I can talk to about this). The option to start from scratch and dive into a completely new industry like software sounds ridiculous to me for a person at my age. I get interested in a lot then can't decide and flame out, again and again. Meanwhile my family watches me thrash about and just don't understand why I don't live and work with them, and just live like that until I get married. Basically, I feel like I'm mooching off of them while there's very little work right now in the business, plus I don't have much to show for the time I have spent here. My parents are stressed that I'm not progressing, and I'm stressed, and this cycle of hoping something will come about in the family business where I can grow, then being let down when it doesn't come through, my exploring a new option, then flaming out because I lose interest, has repeated itself so often that I feel like it's perpetual, it will not end, and I will be the loser I feared most. So I sat down with my journal and just started bawling my eyes out writing what was the first suicide note to my parents saying it would just be better if I weren't in their lives, that it would be one less thing they would have to worry about. No prospects for a bleak future of depression and mediocrity. They can simply be satisfied knowing my sister is at least on her way, has a stable job and graduated with a stellar GPA from a great college. We are all so proud of her. Yeah it might hurt everyone for a bit but then perhaps they would look back and see that this cycle was not going to end, and that it's better this way. I've never been this low in my life that I actually wrote a suicide note to them. I just needed someone to reach out to right now and talk to, so I came here, the first forum I thought of. I don't want to keep thinking about this every few months. I want to either do it or not think about it again. I just honestly think this is the only good option.

Suicide is becoming an increasingly attractive solution. Are these thoughts normal? I don't seem to have much control over them and they creep up and I can't seem to shake them.

"How to Help My Parents Quit Smoking 🚬 
This is not the best place to ask, I understand that. I am out of options. I thought that one of you lot might have gone through a similar situation.

My parents are heavy smokers. They have smoked longer than I have been alive. They were not as addicted a few years ago as they are now. Their addiction has gotten worse over the years. 

They used to hold themselves to certain morals/rules. They would never smoke in-doors/in-vehicles. That has changed. They now have an ashtray in all three of our vehicles. They never smoked around us, their children. At this point, they do not care about that. 

I am adding this in at the very end. Their addiction has got so bad that they are selling random things around the house (like old collectables) just to be able to afford more packs. 

My father has attempted to quit twice before. My mother has prevented him from achieving that goal. Whenever my dad wants to pick up a new habit, my mom puts him down. I know, she is not that good of a wife - at least in this regard. 

They end up going through a few packs (each) a week. A few years ago, one pack would of got both of them through an entire month. It is easy to see how much of a impact smoking has had on their life, and not in a good way. 

I care about their health. I have attempted time-and-time again over the years to get them to quit. Nothing has worked. I worry as I grow older that they are not going to be around, and miss out on future events, like meeting my children - or witnessing me getting married. One could make the argument that I should not concern myself over this due to them being able to die any second. Compared to that, I/they have control over the situation. 

I started throwing out packs here-and-there. What could I do to help them quit? 

Note: Avoid making jokes/leaving comments that do not help me at all. You are not funny.

"Flash Archive Porn Review You may have saw my post a little earlier, but here's some background if you haven't. Earlier today I downloaded Flashpoint because Adobe Flash is shutting down later this year and I wanted a chance to revisit all the flash games I played as a kid. Turns out that while it does have what I wanted there's a little more on top; **flash porn**. Most of these are ""games"", games in quotations because really, they're just animations that I can control the speed of. One thing I noticed right away is that the majority of it was furry porn. If you're not into that then Flashpoint might not be the best place to look for fap material. I would have to guess about 65% of the porn is actually yiff. Like I said, not everyone is into that and you might want to avoid that, and that brings me to the next point and that is the lack of previews. The only thing you see is the title and site the animation was hosted on, no tags or thumbnails included. This means that picking something to jerk off to is purely a guess, but it's also more rewarding to find something good because of said guesswork. However, most of what isn't furry shit is low quality, which is understandable considering that most flash content was produced in the 2000's. With all that said, I did end up finding something to nut to, and yes it was yiff, not afraid to admit that.

Overall, I would give using Flashpoint a 6/10 as a source of fap material. It's not practical for your everyday fap, but if you're looking to spice things up and suprise yourself a little it's worth checking out",,Anxious

5. People who are sensitive introverts just wanting to get away from away from the crazy hell hole that earth is sometimes


6. People who crave what they despise most


7. People who can't let go of childhood as hard as they try

"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",,Depressed

"Dealing with sensory overload Hey guys! I realized that between anxiety and ADHD (And possible other things, I’m not sure) this might be a fairly common thing, I thought I’d share. Basically, sensory overload is when you get too overwhelmed that everything becomes a little too much. People chewing is too loud, people talking is annoying, every little sound is overwhelming, maybe other senses are getting worked up too (mine is usually auditory) so I thought I would share some of my coping mechanisms to help you guys out. 

1. Tell the people around you that you’re dealing with sensory overload right now, so you might be a little snappier than usual. This seriously helps, because a lot of times people assume you’re being rude.

2. Find a quiet space to distance yourself from other people. This helps your senses to reset and helps everything just calm down.

3. Do something easy and absorbing to help distract you. Do some meditation or some colouring. Something that doesn’t require too much concentration. I’ve found that tasks with repetitive motions are very soothing.

4. Calming music like wind chimes can help as well.

These are all the things I could think of, let me know if you all have other things that help you. Cheers!",,Anxious

"Suicide Due to bad breathSo I'm 22 years old now.Graduated from high school in 2015.Went to University but had to dropout in April 2016 for financial reasons.One of the reasons that low-key encouraged me to dropout and not have any high interest in seeking financial help was my bad breath.I applied for the military and went for the interview and was never called,I think my chronic bad breath played a part in that.I applied for a bursary and was accepted into university last year and during the registration I got involved in a situation where my bad breath embarassed me and got depressed and felt like killing myself.I then lost interest in looking for work or institutions to study.Attempted suicide on July this year just the night before my birthday but hesitated asking myself what if this problem will go away eventually.I hasn't but has gotten rather worse.I dropped out of church,I no longer go to town or shops,hate public places and meeting people.The only thing I've been hoping for in the past 3 years is to die.I can't afford to go to a dentist since I don't work.been thinking the problem is my tonsils because they're impacted and have stones but I have sinus and post nasal drip problem as well.

I am naturally a social anxious person and this condition has made it worse for me.I cry every night.my future doesn't look bright.I feel like I'm good as dead and have no purpose in life.been practicing good oral hygiene but it's in vain.I spent the rest of the day hiding in my home and my peers are doing good things with their lives.

This ruined my life. I've lost my personality and character.My naturally low self-esteem got below zero now.I live in fear like a criminal.I can't comment in conversations I would have liked to.

I grew up to be a good head taller than her and stronger but even then I knew how to be afraid of anyone that had so much as a shrink of authority. 

After puberty she wondered a lot why I wouldn't go out and mingle with people, I don't think she knows the impact she had. But to put it in short: I didn't learn how to behave and act with people, books were my escape and still are, I can understand the protagonists and the antagonists when I just don't get the humans around me. 

I tried to learn how to, with group sports especially, but I also went to a psychiatrist, cut contacts with my idiot parents and went on on my own. 

When that failed, I hit other areas of my life I could succeed with, I worked, became a physiotherapist, volunteered abroad for the red cross and at a suicide hotline, got ripped. I joined online dating for months but at the end of the day, I'm not attractive or desirable. 

It got me depressed, so I went back to therapy to handle said depression, it worked and I went back to keep on with life. 

Lately, I've just been contemplating my life. I never had a girlfriend, I barely have friends and I can't be half-assed to keep them for long, I'm balding, wrinkles appear more and more. I'm getting old and I never enjoyed my youth. 

I'm set, I spent life alone and it's not worth it. 

I don't like my life, but I can at least leave on my own terms, my 40th birthday will do, I can binge some series and visit south america which I always wanted to do in the meantime and then I can leave this shitty existence behind.

"Everyday I lose more and more of my motivation.I don't even know where to start with where I am at the moment. 

Today, the manager at one of my jobs called me stupid. I'm not stupid, though. I work extremely hard at this job (which is just some minimum wage job, mind you). I wake up at 4am, leave on foot at 4:45, clock in at 5:20 and work until 1:30. I am never late. I never miss days. I complete my tasks on time sometimes better than on time. I'm courteous to customers.

 I've had to learn a lot in a relatively short period of time. I've been at this job for one month and have never worked in food before. I had always had office jobs. Didn't matter, I learned even though no one was really willing to teach (you read my resume, why fucking hire me then??). If I make one mistake they say ""You do everything wrong"". Or, today it was ""You know some people are smart and can learn something after being shown once"". 

I work two jobs. I'm currently writing this at my second job, where I've spent 45 minutes crying because someone called me stupid. I work from 5am to 7pm everyday. I come in when not scheduled and stay late when asked. I lost another job earlier this summer and I guess I just have jot recovered emotionally. 

It just feels like no matter how much work I put in to anything it will never pay off. I'll always be stupid or have the wrong personality or something. I just don't know why I even do it anymore.

I'm working to pay my rent and have a place to live and sustain a life that to be honest with you I don't even want. I haven't wanted my life since I was a teenager. I'm 25 now not fifteen. I haven't accomplished a single noteworthy thing. Growing up people told me I was smart, but obviously that's not the case or my life would have amounted to more than this. 

Recently I came up with a plan, a really vague plan, that I would save up money and move to a different city in the US. It's possible, I can do it. Probably much more easily than I think. But what would be the point? I'd still just be me. Me in a different town, which means a promising beginning but the same old bullshit. The same storm that is my life. 

What's the point of setting goals if I know that even if I achieve them, I'll still be the same walking disaster? I am waking up every single morning and asking myself this question. I want to be in a relationship with someone, only because it would give me a sense of purpose. I don't want to go back to school; I don't want to keep working like this forever. I don't know what goals I can make that are attainable or viable. I don't know why I don't go to sleep on the train tracks near my apartment. I think about it everyday. I can see myself doing it. I feel more motivated to overcome the fear keeping my from committing suicide than to find a reason to not commit suicide. 

I'm so tired, all the time. I'm done with it.",,Depressed

"My little brother is a freaking brainwashed idiot who can barely think for himself My brother will believe literally any word his dad or our mom says, even if it's false. Our neocon, paganist psuedo-""Christian"" household has officially turned into a '[big lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie)' scheme. He is advised to always hang out with the ""smart kids"" and put the other kids down (and even lie about being bullied, and tattletale, both behind my back), even though my mom and biological dad ***never*** would have put me into a situation like this 12 years ago when I was in the same grade (as my brother now by the same mom and *his* biological dad).

This is not to say that I ""hate"" my brother. I love and will protect my brother to the fullest. Hopefully he will read through this article I posted as he gets older (I will surprise him on his 18th or 21st birthday). The freaking funny ass thing is that my brother, while in the third grade, DESPITE being a general ed student, has the motor skills of a kindergartner or first grader. When I was in the third grade (and I was in special ed during my entire K-12 era), I had the motor skills of a fifth or sixth grader thanks to my smart father (even my mother was sane back then). Unfortunately, my mom has went downhill since marrying my stepdad.

My stepdad is the most illogical and unusual person I have ever dealt with in my life. He is the stereotypical business manager, but his mentality is that of a mid-level high schooler (10th or 11th grader) -- which means officially, I am more mature than my stepdad. He is not raising my brother with individualistic values (like my dad did with me, despite being religious). Instead, my stepdad is rotting my brother with his cult-driven fundamentalistic and collectivistic values, *""rules for thee, but not for me.""* My brother's parents are completely different animals (no pun intended); Mom is the good cop, and his dad is the bad cop.

My brother was given different responses by his parents. Our mom allows him to have both tamales, and his dad allows him to have just one (or one and a half?). I heard my brother ask our mom if he could eat the ""second"" tamale, and she said yeah, but when his dad walked next to the computer desk he was asked how many he had; he answered while he feared, ""..one and a half?"" He asked if he could have the other half, and he was asked if he wants to save it for later and was told that's enough after that. I tried to explain to my brother the fallacy of logic between his parents, and he told me not to worry about him or them.

To make matters worse, my Armenian family worships freed Black slaves and Black civil rights activists despite those people having been known to disobey authority (i.e. police, slave owners, etc.). Without lawbreakers like Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, and I think even Frederick Douglass, White politicians wouldn't give rights to people like them.",,Anxious
"I AM IN DEEP TROUBLE!! MY PARENTS SAW WHAT I WAS DOING AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO INSTALL A PARENTAL APP ON ALL OF MY DEVICES!!! Edit (March 4, 2021 - 4:15 PM eastern): 

First, the OG owner said his parents didn't allow him, and the second owner said he has to use a reddit account for his work (he just needed to create a new one because of too much private stuff), and I am the third owner (just noticed today that the display name and bio of my profile is from the 2nd owner). The account went through an email address and password change ever time the account was sold to a new owner.

Second, I already did factory reset and backup to a NEW iCloud account, but I have Apple devices (iPhone 11 Pro, iPad Air, Apple Watch, and MacBook)

------END OF EDIT------

So this Reddit account wasn't mine at first, it was owned by a once 16 year old when it was first created, but about 3 months later it was sent to a ""new"" owner that was about 28 years old, but about 2 weeks ago it was sold to me (a 15 year old).

But now my parents busted me using Reddit when I wasn't supposed to (that was 2 days ago) and my parents saw a NSFW post. But now I'll have a parental app on my phone in about a week so now I have to check reddit AT SCHOOL (that means yes, I am writing this at school). Because I wrote down the password for this account on a sticky note, I was able to log in at school using a remote desktop on a newly created domain (can't remember the password for this reddit account well because I have a strong password), reddit is blocked at school

My parents are gonna install an app on ALL my devices next week that they can see my actual screen so I have NO privacy, so I guess I'm gonna have to watch toddler videos like Cocomelon for the first time since I was 6 (I'm 15 now, don't remove this because I'm 15). My parents just removed my YouTube premium and adblocker and forced me to use this terrible ChildSafe YouTube client that is set to kids mode so now I have to deal with a childish UI that has random kids sounds on the UI.

So now I may have to sell the account back to the previous owner that is 28 years old or even abandon/delete the account.

"Fucked up my high school career and entire life, not sure how to fix it. My thoughts are eating me alive.I apologize for the upcoming wall of text, but please hear me out. I'm at the end of my rope.

To start, I'm 16, my last day of high school was this past Tuesday. I'm two years ahead. I have 1 1/2 credits to finish online over summer, which I'm halfway done with, as opposed to taking 6 unnecessary classes that could damage my GPA next year.

I work a job 35hrs/wk and make about $900 a month. I currently have $400 to my name and my next paycheck is on the 27th.

My license is suspended due to truancy (didn't turn in absence notes, biggest mistake of my life. Got the letter 20 days before school ended saying my license would be suspended if I didn't serve 30 full days of school, didn't have time to do that and the state DMV isn't responding to us to have it fixed.)

My parents want me to quit my job because my hours are usually 5-11 weekdays or 12-10 on Sundays and despite this being an hour earlier than my curfew (12) before I got grounded two months ago, they say it's too late to be working. I'm lucky to even have a job. I have to beg them to let me work. 11pm is curfew (at least for work I think) for 16 year olds where I live and I think it's completely normal as my friends work the same hours, but maybe I'm wrong.

The reason I'm in trouble with my parents, and understandably so:

My ex boyfriend of a year and a half (18 y/o, met when I was 14 &amp; him 16) got upset at me and told my parents I had a party involving alcohol at a friend's for my 16th birthday party, meanwhile he was having sex with another girl which is why he was accusing me of so many things &amp; verbally abusing me. (Yes I left him, and no it doesn't bother me now - this was a little over a month ago. Who cares. We're young.) -- oh and so you know, it was an actual serious mature relationship that both of our parents agreed with. Not some holding hands and movies shit, we actually had a nice relationship until he lost his marbles. Anyways...

A while back, My parents signed a contract agreeing to emancipate me when I start college (August) if I was able to support myself financially (I would be by then as far as a place to live - emancipation rules where I live don't say I need a car or anything, just money to pay rent, bills, etc. and I could live with another adult instead of having my own place) but they found a bunch of old old old pictures from my party days (really old, I've gotten my shit together since then I swear, I'm completely sober now. It was nothing other than the usual teenage drinking and smoking and I regret it all immensely) and they now have pictures to deem me too irresponsible to be on my own in court.. There was a goof picture of my boobs with my friend in it (nothing sexy just a silly picture we'd taken before a shower. Fully clothed, shirt was just up. Things really do follow you around, huh?... It wasn't online, just on my camera roll. Stupid choice, I know). My stepdad had taken my cell phone and emailed this picture to himself. Which freaks me out even more because my bio. Dad raped me when I was young repeatedly and I don't feel comfortable with men at all now.. I told my mom but he said it was just to show my therapist. Is there really a need to SHOW her?! Just tell her! Don't humiliate me and show my private areas to everyone and their cats!

So basically I'm as grounded as possible, I'm not supposed to have a phone (I PAY MY OWN PHONE BILL TOO!) but my friend came to visit me at work and surprised me with an iPhone which I use on wifi to finish my online course and iMessage friends and whatnot. 

I'm at my wits end. I'm trying to show them I'm responsible and not that person anymore, but they're not believing it. I clean the house, I do what I'm expected to do. I do my own laundry, keep the house clean, do the dishes, etc. Things a typical mature teenager that respects themselves and their parents would do. 

I know I've made poor decisions, and no I don't WANT to move out, but I've always felt as though I'd be better supporting myself rather than being treated now like I'm 12. It's leading me into a very dark place that I spent years coaxing myself out of without much help, and I'm starting to get scared of myself. I know this sounds like a normal punishment, which it is, but I'm about to be in college, I work, I do what I'm expected to, yet I'm given no leeway.. I do a lot for my parents and they do a lot for me. They care about me very much and I don't want them to worry about whether I can make proper decisions. I know that I can, I just wish they'd treat me like the young lady I am and the woman I am becoming/going to become. :( 

I've started making a plan to run away out of state to my best friends' place, I know it's illegal but I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts from thinking I'm not good enough. Please help.

On a scarier note, my biological dad found out where I work and comes in every day trying to talk to me and stands at my register for half an hour until I acknowledge his existence and I'm scared he's going to get me fired. 

What do I do.. My mind is blank and I can't feel anything anymore, I just want my suffering to end. 2 years is temporary but it's not to me. I can't think rationally right now.",,Depressed

"The most humiliating moment of my life.(STORY) So earlier this year, I was hanging out with my friend during lunch. It was just me and him at the table that day, as the two other people who usually sat with us had to retake a test they missed. Anyways, my friend gets up from the table to get some more food from the cafeteria. So I was sitting by myself for a couple of minutes.

While he was gone, two of the hottest girls at the school ask me if they could sit with me. As you would expect, I get super nervous that this is actually happening. I have absolutely no idea why they're doing this, but man am I enjoying it.

They then both ask what my name is, what classes I'm in, the usual stuff. It's mostly the hotter girl of the two asking the questions though. At this point, my irrational thinking mind is thinking that she is about to become my girlfriend. So I start asking her what she does for fun and things of that sort. She tells me that she enjoys hiking a lot.

Before I can ask her anymore questions, my friend returns to the table. As he's walking back, the girl who was asking me all the questions says, ""Damn, he's hot as fuck. Do you know him? I'd love to get his number.""

I told them that I knew him, but didn't know his number. (I actually didn't yet, I had only know him for a couple of weeks and only had his Snap)

"I JUST WANNA BE APPRECIATED🥺 a month ago i asked a nice girl in our hich school to get to know me (not dating but as friends). she told me politely no, because our values were different. i had waited a long time to ask her to meet me after school because i thought she was nice and everything. i knew we had some different opinions but that’s not really a problem because my best friends have the exact opposite opinions than i do. i was really disappointed when she told me she didnt want to get to know me.

so this happened today:

my 20yr half brother was drinking in a bigger city and needed money because he had no place to go (but had money for drinking with friends). he and his mom and sister messaged and called me several times and asked me to borrow some money. i told i could pay his bus ticket if he wanted to go home and he refused. i told them i wont pay a hotel room because i want him to get better and take responsibility. they all got mad and my brother said he wont be helping me in the future and then hang up. he doesnt respect me at all and only calls when needs money. i dont have good relationship with my parents either. they dont really appreciate me and my dad once almost killed me a few years ago. i just want to be loved. im trying to fix our relationship but they make it hard sometimes. 

and then a girl who goes the same high school as i do, but is not following me on social media, just messaged me and asked if she can ask something personal/related to my religion. then i just thought okay i dont give a sh*t anymore and i wrote a LONG message to her explaining how people only think im this boring religious person and nothing more and im not. and i told her i was used to bullied at school and that people at school didnt know how hard my personal life was. i told her that i am religious but my best friends are not. i am religious but i do other things as well than just read the Bible... and so when she had read what i wrote she just told me i shouldnt tell people how i feel. probably she was right but i thought she would say something else. everything what i had just told her was forgotten and she didnt say anything about it. she only asked the question and i answered her.

the thing is. almost everyone, almost every person in our school has like 100 friends and are friends with everyone and then there is me. i have one friend in our whole 1 000 student school. im thankful i have her but ive always wanted to have many friends and i just dont know how to get them. ive tried but no.

what im saying is that i am way much more than just my religion (although it’s the most important thing to me) and i can be fun and do stuff like sneak from bathroom window at night with my friends or travel to random city and stay at 3 star hotell (loose all money) and ask strangers to donate me a a few dollars. and i like watching cat or duck tiktoks or those tiktoks where people are: ”tell me you are a robot without telling me you are a robot.” and i love watching netflix, hbo, disney+ etc. i cry when i think about this world and i pray for people that dont even know i exist. i would die for you who are reading this. and i am super loyal to my friends. i would like more people to acknowledge me. im not the best person in the world and im actually pretty stupid and mean sometimes but i can be a true and loving friend if people just wanted go get to know me. thank you for reading, God bless you❤️ btw im a 17 year old girl.",,Stressed

It's sort of in my head too. I'm trying my best to describe everything but I just can't. It's like a huge black scribble that's finally eaten up every last part of me. But to begin with, I don't think a me existed. Just this outline of a person, but I never really got to develop that person because of all the trauma I've experienced, starting from me being 1 year old. From that point, I became my trauma. It's the only thing I have. It's so deeply apart of me, and with that slowly killing me, it just was piled on with more and more trauma. I feel angry at people, for hurting, when they have so much more than I do. And I know that's cruel. But fucking hell, they all have the people around them, they're loved and cared for! I can only fucking dream of that, because I'm shunned and excluded and hated and left alone. So fucking alone. I don't want this. It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts. I never intended at any point in my life to harm another person or another thing. Not even mildly. And I swear that to God. So why, fucking why can't I have a happy life! I don't want to be dead. I want to be alive and I want to be happy and I want to love and I want to be loved. But, living my life and being me, it's painful. I just don't want to be in pain anymore.

"I need advice. (Reposted for time zone purposes) Long story, tldr at the end.

I recently moved into a new city and joined a new school. Because of the rona situation, school starts off online for me. The teacher asks me to introduce myself with my camera on, so I do so nervously. After a few days a girl approaches me via text and we chat for a bit. We share a lot of interests and she's super smart. Eventually she invites me to a group chat with all her other friends and I'm suddenly part of the popular crowd.

While it's great to have friends, I am usually the loner and the quiet kid, so it's a little overwhelming. It doesnt take long for them to accept me though. Fast forward a few weeks and we've video called a lot and watched movies together etc. I develop a crush on the lady who approached me and I think she flirts at least a little.(mind you I am awful at this and I could just be imagining things)

One day she tells me something which is what has me confused. She says that on day 1 when I turned on my camera she was very smitten by me and thought I was VERY hot. I have a terrible self image and dont think I'm very attractive at all. Though I have been working out a lot for the past year because I've had a lot of free time. I haven't met her irl, but I think she's into me. Issue is, she's an extroverted social butterfly and I'm a stereotypical redditor.

For me, a relationship is very personal and I would only consider asking someone out face to face. Still, I'm crushing hard on her. What should I do?

Tldr; Joined new school, classes start online. Introduce myself on camera. Girl approaches me, becomes friend. Adds me to friend circle, I develop crush on her. Crush says later that she thinks I'm hot. Am confusion.

1: you will be depressed now
2: you will be 14
3: you will get more recognition

And I have to say all of those pretty much happened. Yes, I’m 14 now. Yes, people have noticed that I have aged a year. And yes, I’ve been really depressed. The depressed one is probably the biggest. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed but more frustrated. On my birthday (last Monday) I got homework from 5 of my 6 teachers and basically worked for maybe 3-4 hours straight. Now this is ok because most of the work wasn’t even due that night but still. My science teacher gave me 4 assignments over the week, which was actually not that bad since science is not really confusing to me and most were pretty short. However the same week we took these week long tests inside class that prohibited us from actually doing schoolwork. So I had barely any time to get homework done IN school (which most of my teachers let me do) and that means that I had a lot of work at home. At the same time my math teacher sent us a lot of homework assignments too, same with my English teacher. Nevertheless I barely had any free time at all which just made me sleep deprived and overall just sad. To make things even better my math teacher yelled at us constantly and basically said that only her class was important and piled on homework while we had multiple unavoidable tests given to us by the state.

He’s also out right said that he want to kill him self but us just afraid to hurt his mom and is waiting for an accident. What do can I do for him what do I say?

"Just need to get it all outI’m in so much pain but nobody can know. It’s due to my own stupid mistakes so I Know I deserve it. In the last 2 and a half years I’ve lost so much. My partner and I have grown apart and half the time I wish we had never gotten married. I’ve lost my only child. Been diagnosed with a major mental disorder. The subsequent meds have taken a toll on my body and therefore my self esteem. I ended up having an affair with a coworker and because of it had to leave my dream job. I know I know, I’m a horrible person. I was hoping to leave my current situation and be with my coworker. They told me they loved me, everyday, for 2 years. But when everything came to a head, they didn’t choose me. They never meant what they said. They only said it so they could use me for their own pleasure. For 2-3 years. I know I’m better off away from them, but I truly loved them and I’m heartbroken. How could I not see that I was worth so little?! I should’ve known they saw me as worthless, just a piece of trash to be used and discarded. Everyone has always seen me as worthless. It hurts so much. 

In the last 2 years I’ve made 4 attempts. Wrist-slitting, overdosing, and hanging. I’m trying to stay strong but I think about trying again everyday.

"girl from omegle joins my class zoom So I signed up for Tech Club in October and it was my first time participating on Zoom. I went before the Pandemic started and then they stopped doing it. So for my first time, I joined, they introduced us and everything. Things were nice. A bunch of people joined, one named ""Nicki Minaj"" and ""Anya"". So we were talking about a website development competition and half way into the slideshow this girl, Anya, says ""So what happens if you are from another school?"" which felt really out of place and odd. The teachers didn't understand and wanted to elaborate and she said ""Well, uh, I'm not from this school."". This was tech club for only my school so that was weird. We asked her where she was from and she's like ""Uhh yeah, I'm from Tennaseee"". That was extremely weird. We're in Oregon so that was extremely far away. We asked her how she got here and she told me her that her friends told her about it in a chatroom. We asked her what kind of chatroom and she then said, ""This guy on Omegle spammed the zoom link so I'm like sure whatever"". The teacher asked ""What's an Omegle?"" and the student helping them started sighing and he's like ""Ohhh man Omegle is a place filled with creeps and predators and uh..."", then when we were piecing things together the person named Nicki Minaj just says out of nowhere ""YOU BITCHES DIDN'T LET ME FINI-"" and spammed music before getting kicked. The other students are all silent, then someone asked  ""Whaat was that?"" and the teacher's said ""something innapropiate"".

"Feeling so low actually considering it to be the easier optionI think the worst thing is that no one around you has any idea that everything they are saying, doing or even just their facial expressions make it worse and make it seem like the better option than being around them. I feel completely trapped, no way out and surrounded by toxic parents and a brother who delights in making me unhappy for some reason, even though I have no idea what I did to any of them.  


They all talk about me behind my back, no idea what they say, but when one of them gets in an argument with me they normally end up spilling the beans that they are talking about me and always in a negative way. My brother who actually does nothing and pays nothing gets an easier time than me.  


My dad called my a whore yesterday, because I called him a liar. He said our cats were fighting, I didn't think they were but went to the door anyways. He berated me for living here, which I have no choice, he said it was better when I wasn't there, then the whore part about ten times, wanted to kick me out, stormed over and got in my face to the point my mum had to stand in front of me. He wanted to physically fight me even though I was doing nothing to provoke him, not enough to cause that much of a reaction, but everyone is fine with it.  


The whole time I was responding, staying far back and trying to show him that it wasn't a big deal that we had different opinions. Then last night after it had happened he said ""Sorry for what I was saying before I was just angry"" and that just pissed me off even more. What kind of dad calls their daughter a whore when they are far from it? I tried to say that I didn't care how angry he was, he should never have called me it, then my mum being the enabler she is turned around and said ""But you called him a liar"" ... Am I the only one that thinks this is odd? Why is it okay for someone to say that? Pretty sure liar and whore are two different things, on completely different levels of insult and incredibly nasty to use one over the other. He then got angry saying ""I don't want to go over it again I am just trying to apologise.""   


The reason why I can't forgive him right now is because I don't think he understands what he said and did was completely wrong. I know that it will happen again in the future and I can't be bothered living in a family that never wanted me. If you think this is bad then this is only the surface which makes it even worse, never being able to tell anyone what I actually go through and pretending to be a ""nice family"" when people come over.

"Is it normal to have panic attacks over decisions or is it just me. I know this sounds weird but just listen.

"My family is driving me mad \[ JUST A DISCLAIMER: no, I am not looking for advice, therefore I don't think r/relationship_advice would be a better sub. I'm just ranting, that's all.\]

Some probably needed backstory:  
I've been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and ADHD, but the anxiety is the most important here. Thanks to it, I can't sleep for periods of time longer than about half an hour, because every single sound jolts me awake. It has caused me to somehow only live off of short naps, that don't really help me rest. I've spent most of my high school experience on caffeine, and sugar, just to keep myself awake. (Yes, I know it is not healthy, but my parents don't let me take sleeping medication because I will ""overdose and kill myself"". FYI, with the doses, I'd need to eat several hundred of them to do anything besides falling asleep for longer. I did my research.  
During the lockdown, I have had an even worse time sleeping, so I basically spend my time writing unneeded stuff, and randomly walk around the house.  
Everything was quite alright until I came out. I trusted my mom the most, so when I asked her NOT to spill the beans to anyone, I thought she would do exactly that. Boi, was I wrong. First, she decided to get me a therapist to ""get me out of my phase"", tell my whole family, and everyone she knows. Now every member of my family has been colder to me than ever, but I can live with that for a few months.  
What I'd actually like to talk about here, is my fricking sister. She calls me things, but I endure that. She somehow breaks into my social media, and tells my mom about every guy I've ever talked to, saying ""one of them is my boyfriend"". No privacy? Slurs? Just a few more months, and it's going to be the end of that. Now what else could she do, knowing my daily schedule? Tell my parents ""the only thing I do is playing video games"" (which is kind of true, to be honest). I mean, they would leave me alone for the last few days of the summer holidays (our schools will start in, like, three days or so), right? NOPE, they took away everything, and I'm typing this on my old, useless laptop.  
Could there be something worse? Well, I recently decided to repeat the process of over-exercising until I can pass out in my bed. Did that again yesterday, and my sister, who FOR SOME FRICKING REASON decided to sleep in my room, instead of her own, kicked me repeatedly, and forcefully in the chest ""to wake me up"", because ""I didn't clean the cats' toilet"", despite her seeing with her own eyes, that I did. Did I mention it happened at 4 am? Because I should have.

Here are the tips which helped me during high school and they are still useful in college for me at least.

1) The secret to look cool in front of everyone is giving respect. The bad boy theme is sooo 90s.

2) All the boys and girls who think you are not good looking or pretty, it is just in your head. You look fucking amazing. Just groom yourselves properly and see the magic yourself. You will be oozing out confidence like never before.

2.1) Don't fell bad if you don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend, you will eventually get one. These things shouldn't be rushed. If you are making relationships just for the sake of having one, there is a huge chance that you won't be happy in the long run and might miss the chance to meet someone who is actually perfect for you. So just relax...and enjoy your single life also.

3) Give respect to teachers who are nice to you and don't be a jerk to them, they also feel bad and have mental breakdown. For the bad teachers....show them hell.

4) Never compare your wealth with other kids, it's not cool.

5) Don't worry about your studies and do what you like the most. That doesn't mean to completely neglect your studies, try as hard as you can and if it still doesn't work then don't stress yourself too much. Just have faith in yourself and you will definitely succeed.

I've never felt this horrible before. Horrible is an understatement. These past few days have been the worst ever and it's all my fault. I've ruined everything, I'm sure I have.

I've always thought ""there's no way this can get any worse"" and then it does. Oh my god it hurts so much. I can't eat, I can't drink. I'm so tired but my mind won't let me sleep.

"Not sure what to doI used to go to an Ivy league school. Last winter, I was having a really tough time and wanted to kill myself. I decided to ask for help. I didn't have much faith in the psychiatric process, but I was hoping that someone would be able to give me a reason to get up each day: a reason to do something rather than be nothing.

Much to my surprise, after being put in a mental hospital, I was thrown out of school. I was sent home with a 2 week prescription for an antidepressant and told that I could reapply in the future. I reapplied for this current term and was rejected. Apparently they think I need more time to recover (even though they didn't bother to talk to my doctor from home, or give me any warning that I might not be reaccepted until a week before the beginning of the fall semester).

Sorry for the tedious background story, but I wanted to provide some context for my question. Why should I keep trying; why should I try so hard to eke out an existence when pretty much every day is fucking miserable?

I've spent a long time in therapy; I've probably taken half a dozen different anti-depressants. The only times in my life where I've felt even the slightest hope for the future were the result of massive delusions as to what is possible/plausible. I've only ever felt slightly happy under the influence of terribly unrealistic dreams.
Now I have no idea what to do. Should I keep trying to go through the admissions process for my former college? Should I find a new university that might accept me as a transfer? What should I do for the next couple of months? I probably should go out and find a job, but why? Why should I go to all that effort? What exactly is the end goal I'm working towards?

I've thought about I wanna do and there's two option. One is to be friendly and tell him after class that I think he's really cool or something like that and ask him if he'd wanna hang out. The other would be to just be straight to the point and ask him if he'd like to go out with me. 

The problem is that I have mad anxiety (as probably seen in the above paragraph LMAO) and, while I can brush the fear of rejection off, I'm worried he's gonna think I'm weird for asking him out after never talking to him.

"All the things I wish somebody told me when I was a teenager # 1) If you have a crush, DO NOT spam them with messages.

Play it cool, do your own thing and spend time off your phone. If they don't reply to you, don't follow it up with another message to try and get them to respond. They're either busy or not in the mood to chat - accept it. Let them come to you. If you play it well and take your time to reply, it can get somebody to like you.

# 2) If somebody is making fun of you, don't give them a reaction

When I saw people getting bullied, they all had one thing in common: They reacted. 

People who freak out when you call them names are much more likely to get picked on, and people who take things too seriously are less likeable.

It's better if you're able to make fun of yourself. You can have the fattest, weirdest looking kid in school, but if they can laugh and make fun of themselves and they handle ""banter"" well, then they're likeable.

There's two kinds of ""bullying"", heres how to handle each:

* Banter: The person doesn't have bad intentions and is just poking fun. Usually they will be smiling as they say things. This can still be hurtful, but the best thing to do is to add something to it and poke fun at yourself. At the minimum, just smile or laugh, but the laugh can't seem fake.
* Bullying: Usually done by the kid with a bad home life. He wants to hurt your feelings, and will say stuff to try and upset you. The solution here is to just scoff at them and walk away. If you think they're dangerous, just try avoiding them and walking away. Don't show fear.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3) If somebody invites you somewhere, GO

This one is pretty self explanatory. Going to parties and engaging with people can help you meet others. Even if you don't really feel like going, sometimes it can be worth it and it can make you glad you went. This can help you become more popular.

&amp;#x200B;

# 4) Don't try too hard

Don't focus on becoming popular. The people who become popular are the people who don't try, the ones who don't care about popularity whatsoever. It's best to just *be yourself*. I know that advice is cliché as fuck so I'm sorry, but if you are confident in yourself and aren't trying to fit in, you will be accepted. Don't try and talk in every single situation, just let yourself be quiet sometimes. Nobody likes it when a person just waits to say whatever they want to say instead of listening to the person speaking and respinding.

# 5) Don't pretend to like stuff that you don't really like.

Even many adults do this, and it's pretty easy to spot. When somebody they want to get closer to names a hobby of theirs, they will pretend to like it too just to get closer to them. It's okay to relate to people if you know about the conversation topic, but make sure you say ""I'm not the biggest fan of X, but I like X"". You want to be open about your true preferences, even if it doesn't match your friends/crushes. If they're into you, they will listen about your passion even if it isn't a passion of theirs.

&amp;#x200B;

# And above all, honesty is key. 

Honesty is scientifically proven to make you a more likeable, trustable person. Stay honest and truthful, say what's on your mind if you're upset, and tell people when you have a crush on them. It might backfire, but you miss 100% of the shots you don't take (another cliché im rly sorry).

"boom, headshotI've been thinking about suicide for a long time. The depression started about 5 years ago and was followed by severe anxiety and social paranoia. In the early stages of my depression I reached out to a close friend and told him about the thoughts that were going through my head, how everything felt bland and nothing made me happy anymore but he told me it was just a phase that everybody goes through and it would get better with time, so I waited. 

When the anxiety started, my friends started to notice my behavior and began to ask why I was acting so crazy so I started ignoring their calls and making excuses to be alone so I wouldn't have to answer their questions. The social paranoia came last but not least and It hit like a truck. Everywhere I went, it felt like people were watching me and judging everything I did. It was like they were whispering about me behind my back, and it was as if even my friends were out to get me. The weight of those 3 behemoths were too much for me to handle, so I confined myself to my house for about 3 years to dwell in my own self-loathing and disgust. It's been 5 years and I'm still waiting for it to get better, but it only seems to get worse and I'm running out of patience. I know suicide is a selfish act and it will hurt the few people that I have left but I don't want to deal with this anymore. I'll be remembered as a coward who couldn't face his problems but I couldn't care less. 

In the end I've decided on a rather messy ending for myself, but from what I've read it's not very painful and has a high fatality rate. My only concern is what my family will see if they need to identify my body,  I don't want to scar them with that image.

What has actually happened I have no idea. So when I was in middle school I was extremely nervous while talking to people (mostly girls) but I figured out a girl actually liked me and I flipped out as I thought it was impossible. I was already nervous before but now I was really nervous. I was also in band with said girl and all of her friends where also in band. I acted extremely weird constantly and made a fool of myself. All the girls took it as me being a creep and they all sent me notes telling me how much of a creep I was when in reality I was just nervous. I was pretty screwed up for a solid 4-5 months after that but I got over it. Jump forward to high school and all the girls in my band had left (probably because of me) and I ended up being the 1st trombone because of that. Yeah... It's pretty weird and I'm still trying to piece together what happened,,Anxious
"Being alive is hellBut dying... I feel like I will be copping out without trying to figure out all the life shit first.

I'm in an abusive not-marraige, I can't tell anyone what's happening to me or they'd try to help and make it worse. 

My kids have to deal with me being absent mentally and barely functional because of whats happening... And a long history of C-PTSD and depression on my end.

I love my children so much. I hide all this from them, they are too little and it would damage them immensely to know what was really happening.

I didn't want kids, not when I had them. I knew it was too soon...

But I didn't have the courage to abort. (Hyper religious upbringing). Not til way later, twice, after any inkling of religion was pounded out of me.

You can only deal with what I have for so long before God either becomes an enemy, or a sad fairy tale told to the foolish and naive.

And I would think that it was temporary... Except this has gone on in some form my entire life. It's unspeakable. I will never, never get justice for what has been done... I can barely speak about it in even the most general terms.

In addition to that, I am now being evaluated for an uncommon and highly stigmatized disorder.

I just want to have a normal life.

Just be able to do normal things. Get out of bed to a house that's not a pig sty, mostly thanks to chronic illness and my incredibly useless excuse for a ""partner"" who barely works rn and gets paid to stay home... but still makes no progress on the mess and won't communicate about it without becoming abusive and effectively traumatizing me into a meltdown and shutdown. 

I have no one.

I am an orphan, there is nowhere to run. I have tried.

The shelters are worse than home.
The few ""friends"" who offered me and the children shelter, expected me to be healthy (despite me being very open about my health issues and mental health severity) and then tried to exploit me as bad or worse than he does.

For example, this years theme is Communication in History. You would think that this corresponds to quarantine and stuff like that, right? So you want to write your paper on something like the phone right? Wrong. They ENCOURAGE you to find some topic that absolutely no one fucking knows or cares about. Not to mention, this is piled ON TOP of all the other assignments from teachers. Its extra stress for no fucking reason. This project also lasts like 8 fucking months.

"The Tunnel is an Illusion, the Light is Now (129) I used to always think that I had to fight through the tunnel to get to the end, then one day I realized that the tunnel is an illusion and the light is always available to connect with **now.** 

I am not saying that anxiety is fake, that depression isn't real, because that is something i have lived with my whole life, but rather that the mindset that the ""light"", better known as happiness, positivity, optimism, comes with time, is **fabricated.** It isn't a time where we reach where we are ""happy"" all the time, ""positive"" all the time, ""optimistic"" all the time, ""never in pain"", but **rather that these are all achievable daily, through moments.**

It is all about the precious moments we are given. It is all with the moments we are given to breathe, be alive, try again and try something new. 

In the moments, minutes, hours, days, months, years ahead, find moments of light during each day. When we find it even for a few seconds, it will continue to grow, the more we try and find it daily and with time, the light will always be able to connect with; **through the highest of highs and lowest of lows.**

As he walked, flowers began to sprout, finding life anew. Clouds from his lands follow behind as an omen of life. The rains began and life ran rampant. People never walked through these lands, he was the first, and yet instead of destroying what little there was, he created life from nothing. Deer followed, and then the birds, and then the decay to begin life over again. Sand turned to dirt, dirt began life, and life made room for death. The circle of life had been restored to these distant lands. The strangers journey was near it's end, as he walked through the mountains the petals of the new found life fade. The deer perish, leaving the life which was given for the short time. Then the dirt degraded and turned back to the uninhabitable earth as it had began. Life drained from the desert, leaving it as barren as it had started. The earth continued it's breathes as if this brief moment had not interrupted the barrenness.",,Stressed

"Not sure what's going on with meSo little background for me. I'm a 30 year old single guy. Last year I had some really bad thoughts after a breakup and went to seek help. I was at work one day and broke down. Cried uncontrollably, and kept thinking of bad things that can happen to me. Before that I kept getting these horrible migraines and I was afraid that there was something wrong with my head. I went to the doctor and explained what had happened and they said it was most likely a panic attack and suggested I get on an antidepressant. 

Fast forward to about 8 months later now. I have been doing much better, I never took the pills prescribed to me, and never went back to the doctor. Not sure if that was the right thing to do or not. Last night my friend and I got into an argument and before going to bed I looked out on my patio and kept thinking what would happen if I jumped? I live on the 24th floor so I know the end result. The thought just wouldn't leave my mind for some reason. 

I do have random thoughts of jumping out in front of cars, jumping off buildings, doing things to myself, just more dark thoughts really. I've learned to handle my panic attacks pretty well, like right now typing this I'm realizing how crazy this all sounds and I notice my breathing has gotten heavier, and I feel pressure on my chest.

Failed 5 driving license tests, out of the whole educational offer i took a useless mickey mouse degree that i hated. 5 years after my ""great plan"" started i failed at literally everything.

Im now 23, no schools wanted me / with a postal strike my marks and other important materials never reached some of the school on the deadline. Ive been on anti-anxiety medication for 8 months, went from 220lbs to 300, started working out to help with my depression and weight and Im back down to 260ish. To make matters even better with the anti-anxiety medication I have about every sexual side effect listed. The medication made me even more depressed, a girl is interested in me? too bad my dick doesnt work and who would want to be with someone who cant get it up? ive gained 80lbs and look like shit because of these drugs that were supposed to help. I still hate myself and cant stand looking at what a failure I am in the mirrior. I cant stand looking at my mom and dad, they pay and go out of thier way to provide me with everything to end this depression. I cant face them again and tell them that Im planning on killing myself again. I know they would never admit it, but me leaving would be a great boon to them, i wouldnt be the failure 23 year old with only 1.5 years of university done, they wouldnt be a laughing stock amongst thier friends / co-workers. Im sure im a constant joke, and i cant keep dragging my family down. Im sick of pretending to be happy, joking with people, and smiling. I just want to lay down and never wake up.

"When my dog died, and my dad blamed it on me Now, I love dogs. I have always enjoyed there company, rather they like it or not. We used to have 4 dogs at once. The first dog was named Charlie. He was a very small dog, he had lots of anxiety, and he absolutely HATED interaction with other dogs. He was eventually given away to an older couple, and I am extremely happy knowing that he probably has a better life now.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, years later we get 2 more dogs, they are German Shepard pit bull mixes. One was named Donut, she was the girl of the group, she was basically a full on German Shepard with her looks, and the other is Flash, the big gentle giant of the group, he is way more chill than donut, so I used to always sit down and play Skyrim with him laying down by me. A few months after they where adopted, we got another dog on August 13th. He was a puppy, probably a full bred pit bull, but to this day, he doesn't have the size of a pit bull. Why is that? Well he was sitting outside of the school we go to, starving, and almost guaranteed he was going to die if he didn't get to safety within a few hours. He was adopted, and thus he became the cool guy he is today.

&amp;#x200B;

Onto the story. It was May of last year, and my dad was really keen on making Flash and Donut outside dogs. It was extremely hot that year. I made sure to play with the dogs everyday, and spend time with them. They where outside 24/7. I would sometimes spill a gallon of water over them so they would stay cool, also it would make the flies stop attacking them for a little while. They really appreciated it.

&amp;#x200B;

May comes. My sister feeds Donut, and she gives her water, she drinks so much, she even throws up. My sister told me about that, I look up why that is. I assumed the worst, and I begged, and even got grounded because I yelled at my dad, trying to get her back inside. Ultimately, that same day, she died.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few days, and my dad begins to act up. He says that she died due to spider bites. Now, at face value, that may be believable, but when you begin to think about it, it made no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\-She displayed literally 0 signs of a spider bite-She was perfectly normal up until that morning, when it got extremely hot-Her fur is so thick, that a spider would have a hard time biting her more than anyone else

&amp;#x200B;

A few days pass, my dad forces me into an argument for literally nothing as he usually does. I just agree with all of the bullshit that comes out of his mouth, because the alternative is worse. Then he says something that really set me off:

&amp;#x200B;

""Maybe if you had cut the grass, no spider would have been able to kill Donut""

&amp;#x200B;

This made me very close to actually wanting to break him. The lawn mower had no gas, I couldnt even cut the lawn, and to add on, she's outside, tied to a large tree 24/7. Cut grass would not have reduced the chance of a spider biting her, even if it did. His lack of care was the reason she died, but he wanted to blame me, somebody who is still very sensitive to her, as it was a few days past.

&amp;#x200B;

These days, the remaining dogs, Flash and Rocky just sit inside of the cage all day, because he will not allow us to take them out, and let them play upstairs. I dont have much input on the situation, but I do the best that I can, by when they are assigned to go outside and pee, and keep them out there and play with them for a long time. To this day, the dogs still like me more than anyone else in the family. I miss the days where me and Flash could just chill, and probably fall asleep together, as I play skyrim, and pet him.

i never opened up to anybody before but today is a day that i hope never happened.

i am terrified, i can't think straight and english is not my first language so sorry if all this doesn't seem to make sense.

so, i am a teenager who has spent all her life being the strong one. I'm the smallest(?) child of three and even if we always were good with each other there's a lot of issues and we all struggle with expressing emotions like sadness and anger because my mother who raised us alone was raised in a hostile climate and never taught us how to deal with those feelings.

my father was abusive and violent but thankfully he never did anything to me. my brother was his favorite so he didn't get hurt either but I grew up seeing my sister being punished and hit violently regularly. tbh all my memories are blurry but one time he whipped her so hard she bleed and this image has stuck with me since.

thankfully my mother managed to make him leave home but to this day he still has a grip on us and is in our life because of many divorce issues and other bs. this asshole stole a bunch of our money and my sick mother can't do any more than she does.

anyways, after he left (i was between 8 and 11 old at the time, my brain won't let me remember exactly) i went to a psy but idk if i rigged the exams or if it was just hidden but they couldn't find anything wrong w me. my sister had severe depression and i think she tried to commit suicide i have no clue. my brother is a special case, he has always been weird and I've never seen him cry and he's kinda toxic each time i express sadness so i prefer not to talk abou

On paper my life rules. I'm 28, I'm a good looking dude, my girlfriend is hot as fuck, I make bank, great family, friends, etc.

I am not sad. I am not angry. I'm totally indifferent. Bored even. And if you asked me one thing I wanted to do I wouldn't be able to tell you. I've done everything I wanted to do. I've achieved my goals. But I'm still here. Every day is exactly the same, and I wouldn't change it because I like it, but I'm over it.

Does that even make sense? It's like if you go to Disney world, and it's great. You go on everything, you see all the attractions, and now it's time to go. It's not like you suddenly don't like Disney world. You just have no desire to re ride the rides. The trip is over.

This is how I've felt for years. I've slowly stopped doing everything I've always liked to do because I've taken those things as far as I care to. And now it's like... I need to watch myself get old and die over the next 40 years? Why? I don't want to get married, and I never want kids. There's nothing left to do.

I used to think I was depressed. I tried celexa, Zoloft, wellbutrin, and another I can't remember. I've had a series of sessions with a therapist.

My parents are relatively healthy so we usually don’t have a ton of sugar in the house. Sometimes, we will have a bag of chocolate chips or marshmallows or something like that. When we do, I a can never resist grabbing a bunch and consuming them. Last year, I would use my own cash to buy candy that i wasn’t allowed to have. This year, after Halloween, there was a huge bag of candy in my house. I got into a bad habit of not eating breakfast and “forgetting” my lunch at school only to walk home and binge eat candy. 

If I was put in a candy store, I don’t think I would be able to stop eating until everything was gone. 

I don’t know. Because of my family, I’m not really exposed to that much sugar and that has definitely been a good thing. I’m just worried that as I get older, I won’t be able to cut off the weight and I’ll just keep eating.

Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to gain, because life's greatest lessons are learnt through pain. -Nagato 

The rests are just as important as the notes. 

Don’t give them a taste of their own medicine. They already know what it tastes like. Give them a taste of your own medicine. 

Let kindness be the main attraction. 

Look for a love where you can say, “I love you even though,” instead of “I love you but,”

Don’t cross an ocean for someone who won’t even cross a puddle for you. 

Count the garden by the flowers, never by the leaves that fall. Count your life with smiles and not the tears that fall. 

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. -Eleanor Roosevelt

You can't start the next chapter if you keep rereading the last.

You don't know me, you've created your own character and attached it to me, he made me some imaginary character, and all the things he attached to that character, he told everyone but me about, essentially making sure no one would want to talk to me. I endured this until the end of high school really. You know what the sad thing is? I really did try being his friend, I fucking did, but every time I was there, he shot me down by humiliating me in public. It got terrible in high school, everyone started following off him, including people I was in class with alllll day. They were my friends I think, I really have no idea. They were cool to me not much of the time, alot of the time they would be a my friend at a tuck shop, or if no one else was in that class that day if they weren't there. Except for jonah, jonah was fuucken cool with me, although if he was outside with all the others he would just do the same and ridicule me.

"Falsely accused of rapeWhen I was in high school, my then-girlfriend sent me snapchats of her semi-naked in her brother's room with him in the photo. I couldn't prove anything illegal was going on, but I was disgusted and creeped out, so I broke up with her immediately after. 

She wanted revenge. She took a knife and scratched into a bathroom wall ""/u/falselyaccused214567 is a rapist. Don't go near him!"" and went around telling everyone she knew. For a while people refused to speak to me, and I was gawked at with horror and disgust wherever I went.

  
Years on, the nightmare just never ends. My brother works kitchens at a local conference centre, and the girl working there decided to tell him and show him the photo of the carving. People instantly block me on social media once they find out who I am. If I say hi to anyone, they look down and walk away quickly.

  
We live in age where accusation = guilt. Nobody cares about the character of my ex or what she did, all she had to do was say it and was instantly 100% believed. My ex didn't need to say anything to the kitchen girl either: she decided to do her work for her. As if my life wasn't ruined enough, this random girl decided just to make me suffer some more and cause more of a reason for division and hatred in my family.

This will follow me for the rest of my life. You know Brett Kavanaugh? I don't know if he's guilty or not. I wasn't there, and I'm not a judge or jury. But what bothers me is that he's on trial in his 50s for what he supposedly did in high school. And in my case, it was a lie for revenge to begin with. You can throw whatever statistic about how common it is all you want, whether it's 2% or 10% or whatever the feminists come up with nowadays. It still happened to me and I'm innocent. But that doesn't matter- I'm just a worthless, disposable adult male, and I can have my life ruined on a whim.",,Depressed

"Bad Breath I'm genuinely baffled my my older brother's bad breath. Someone tell him to eat some walnuts. 

So my(14f) brother(16m) always throws tantrums when he's angry, and he gets angry we're just joking around with him often. Yesterday he took a nap for 6 hours from 2:30pm to 8:30pm and my sister, dad, and I were joking with him, and he got way too frustrated and angered in the moment.

Anyway, I, being the direct, youngest child that I am, commented on him storming out. He, in turn gets super close to my face to the point our noses are touching, and starts tearing into me. I didn't really care, but his breath was really, really bad. Probably because he had joke woken up, but still. Like, why does his breath always stink? And why do I know his breath always stinks? Idk.

I thought about backing away but i had to assert dominance and instead I just thought of headbutting him Tanjiro style. I didn't, I just waited until he finished and then said another thing because he was being a twat, and then he brought up every issue he'd ever had with me, so I walked away before we got into a proper fight. 

I realize this a really stupid story of a small interaction I had with my brother, but I seriously don't know why his breath always smells bad. Whenever I smell it (which isn't often lol, usually it's just like when he's showing me a video on his phone and we're close together or smt) it's always rancid. He also has to brush after every meal because teeth stuff, so why does it's smell so bad? I asked him once and he said it was the dried spit in his invisiliners, but like, wash them??? Please??? For your sake?? You kiss your girlfriend with that mouth, bro.

I'm not really asking for advice or anything, i just wanted somewhere to talk about this with that probably won't backfire in my face.

I'm thinking of a quick death, but I'm not really worried because of those thoughts, although they are very unpleasant. I'm quite sure that I wont' take my life because I'm telling myself I'm not worth it, although sometimes I'm happy that I don't have access to stuff that could endanger me.

But that's not the point of my title. I have a feeling that this struggle of knowing that if I could come out the other end and the suicidal ideations is wearing me down. I'd like to come to peace someday and that's where I see suicide as an option. Not to opt out of life because I don't like it, but because I just can't deal with the the struggle anymore. It's like two world colliding and I'm in the middle of it and everytime they collide, I take a hit, and I don't know how many hits I can take eventually.

So why not actually commit suicide?  There are 3 outcomes to actually doing it 

1. There is an afterlife
2. reincarnation
3. nothing and you merely cease to be conscious 

Why not go through with it?  If there is an afterlife and a god surely he'd understand that it was him who created me and made me think and function the way I do.  If he cannot get over that fact then I'd rather chill in hell with some real interesting free thinkers

2. I come back as someone else.  This would be sweet.  It would be like a re-roll of a game character.  Maybe next time around i wouldn't suck with people and actually have a talent worth pursuing

3. This is what I think happens.  You just die and cease to think.  Like a dreamless sleep that you don't wake up from.  No worries.  No problems.  Nothing but nothingness.

"Multiple rape victim from an abusive home. Tired of fighting a losing battle.My life was great, then my father died when I was 4. My mom went crazy (literally), began physically/verbally/emotionally abusing me. She set all my clothes on fire once, killed a pet rabbit I had, etc. The usual bruises and tears nonsense. I've been working since I was 14 to help financially support the family, and I'm lucky enough to attend an Ivy League university now (for whatever that's worth). My mom never remarried and has no friends, and considering what happened after my father died, I worry that me cutting her out of my life would be beyond disastrous for her. I love her, and I want her to be happy and proud of me more than anything. 

I've also been raped by three different men. Before, I was raped by one of my high school teachers, and once by a grad student at my school. For the last eighteen months, a man who was an authority figure in my life has been routinely coming to see me, either when I'm home alone, or driving up to my university for the weekend. He knows about the situation with my mom because he was someone I confided in, and he knows that I haven't gone forward about either of the previous two rapes because I'm worried about what that might do to her (my mom's ethnic culture suggests that suicide is a reasonable response to being raped, and I don't want her to think that she's somehow failed as a mother). He's been forcing himself on me pretty regularly, too. He's rougher than the other two, and I usually end up with some amount of bleeding after. He likes beating me with his belt, he's bought toys to use on me, etc. He keeps tally of how many lashes he's going to give me the next time he sees me. He adds to the tally if I do certain things, like if he sees on Facebook that I've gone out with another guy, or if I forget to say goodnight to him every night. 

It occurs to me that I could hypothetically leave all this behind and run away to another state or country, but beyond not wanting to hurt my mom, I've realized that the combined years of mental fuckery that I've had inflicted on me has probably made for one pretty broken toy. As stupid as it is, I worry that once I leave, I won't have anyone in the world, and that sounds as bad as my current life. Pathetic, right?

"My love for school and the wonderful feelings it fills my heart with (/s). When I'm outside of school I usually feel confident, sociable and in tune with myself, but walking through the hallways of my school makes me unusually self-conscious.

I am 18M, I really like my aparance and personality, I know I've got a rich and interesting ""inner world"" (for lack of a better term), I'm well adjusted despite my terrible childhood and I know from experience that I can be very charming if I put in some effort.

I'm confident.
I've even gone through a youth militarily program and didn't come out messed up at the other side.
But for some reason being in school just makes me slowly die inside.

I feel so damn self conscious inside those god forsaken walls. 
I know that teenagers are for the most part horrible judgemental people (kinda /s) but I've hung out with shitty people before and felt right in my element. I can hang out or party with strangers with no anxiety. I've approached girls that catch my fancy without feeling very nervous. 

But walking around school is somehow very trying for me.

It might stem from how stifling school feels in general. I'm pretty introspective and intelligent, and I grew up without much outside influence from my peers. I'm my own person and proud of it, but it can be incredibly hard to relate to the people around me in school.

Anyway so in school we use google chat to communicate or you know update the students about school stuff, and since I’m the “class clown” (the kid who likes attention in class) I decided to write a sarcastic message about how I really dislike my classmates and that I deserve more respect. I know you have to have pretty big guts to pull off something like this, especially when the teacher can directly see what you’ve written. 

You might wonder, why would you actually do this kind of thing that’s going to get you in trouble? And you know that’s right and all but that’s not really the main issue I’m worrying about. The issue that I’m really afraid of is after I published that message I began to overthink, like that my classmates are going to change their view about me, I’m usually the funny guy that everyone laughs with and for them to see that I’m writing a message like this is going to change their perspective of me in a negative way.

What should I do? Should I just move on because school starts in 16 days? And what about the girl that I really like. Do you guys think she will dislike me even more because of the message?

"Is my friend genuinely depressed or just wanting attention?So my 'friend' started messaging a group chat at 10 pm with my other friends of how he is emotionally sad. He has ideas of killing himself using a knife next to him while saying he was intoxicated by sending a past photo of alcohol from a social event. We try to talk him out of suicide by saying the general ""what's wrong"", ""talk to us"", etc..

Being in this extreme situation, he suspects that one of us might call the police in which he responds to threatening to kill the guy who calls 911 first. We felt obligated to prevent this guy from killing himself, so one of us had called the police, and he said around eight cars had shown up around his house. This had pissed him off as all he wanted was attention and not being recommended by cops to visit a weekly therapist.

The next day at school, this was discussed between my friends whether if he was okay and what all the drama was about yesterday. I do feel guilty about not keeping it confidential. He was angry with us talking about it so openly and demanded to know who started all these rumors in order to find someone else to talk shit about (we all did).

However, we discover that he is regular in trash talking behind other people's backs and a bully towards the skinny. He got sad from out pour of constant karma.

Before my friends and me had experienced this, the previous group of friends this year and another year before had fallen for the same distraught from him using the exact same story of being sad and suicidal without admitting his own wrongdoings.

I feel like we have been manipulated into being a parachute for this guy as he constantly gets himself into the consequences of his own actions and uses a mental health disorder to get attention.

The day we blocked him IRL was when he wanted us to do his homework as he will no longer attend school. The next week he came to school and asked me to buy him food and then he resumed with the regular trash talking.

She is often not home, which was good at first. I didn't have to deal with her telling me how useless I am and I was happier but recently she has not even been telling me she is leaving. She will leave for weeks at a time without a call or text and the turn up in the middle of the night, yell at me in the morning for not keeping the house clean and the disappearing later that day. I don't think she has any care for my feelings let alone actually love me. I feel completely broken down. I have tried to talk to my siblings about her and how I feel (I guess as some sort of reassurance that I'm not just making life more difficult for myself) but of course my older sister can't relate to my feelings. 

Last year I was arrested and that's when everything got worse. Of course I would expect any parent to be angry and there should be some sort of consequence to my behavior but then my mother began yelling at me and gaslighting me. I guess because I had grown up with her like this I didn't really fall for her tricks anymore so when I tried to deny her accusations she called me insane and said I need to be put away. She knew at the time I was very insecure when it came to people talking about my mental instability (At the time she knew I had already attempted suicide and was suffering from psychosis). She knew I felt disconnected from my brain and that I don't trust or believe myself and she decided to claim she knew I had done specific things, varying from stealing from her and my older sister, getting in fights to other minuet things such as smoking indoors or being friends with certain people. Of course I denied everything that I did not do but instead she said there's proof and that I'm crazy if I seriously don't think I did those things and believe my lies. At this point I was already questioning myself so I asked her to show me the proof. She showed me text messages from my sister saying that I had stolen from her but it's alright because I payed her back. I never stole from her. I never payed her back. I never saw my sister the weekend that she claimed because I was not even at our apartment. I never understood why they did this. I broke down and she refused to leave me alone even though I was in hysterics while questioning my sanity, at the time I told her that if this was real she needed to allow me to readmit myself into psychiatric care but of course she refused. I later asked my sister why she lied to our mom like that, she said she never sent those texts but I saw her number but decided not to push it any further because thinking about the scheme made me upset. Neither has ever apologized to me and honestly I still don't know who was involved or if I somehow did steal from her.

I was grounded for 3 months which made me severely depressed being stuck in my uncomfortable household with them. I ended up sneaking out often and got caught on one of the last days of my punishment. I didn't come home so my mother called the police and I got grounded for another 3 months. I decided to try my best to prove to her that I was not a terrible person but she still has no trust in me and searches my room which makes me uncomfortable. I wish I could leave. I genuinely do believe as soon as I move out my mental state will improve drastically. I hate my family.",,Depressed
"I kind of beggining to feel like I should kill myselfI am a 30 year old virgin. The culture I was brought up in and my mom especially made sex and relationships heavily taboo. I actually don't even know how to act around people and especially women. 

I don't get any of the informal signals nothing. I just wing it, and come across as creepy and desperate. I used to think it was me being fat and ugly holding me back. I have lost over 40 pounds from 200 to 150s and have muscle and am in great shape. 

Also to mention I'm a brown dude in a white city but even the brown girls seem to spurn my looks and advances. I have no friends, the only person I talk to regularly apart from fake interactions with coworkers is my brother.

I am beggining to feel like the Rheseus monkeys that are socially dysfunctional from Harlow's experiments. I act on the wrong cues, based on the fact that I already have a stereotypical disadvantage to begin with being a different color, then add to that social ackwardness and its a recipe for disaster. Just like the monkeys I fight when I shouldn't, I approach when I should act indifferent, and these are picked up by people and I get socially excluded. Then begins a vicious cycle where this long term loneliness creates further stress and inconfidence and makes the small chance of getting somewhere seem all the more unlikely.

At this point the suffering that I feel is genuine and real. I feel a natural urge to connect with people and to try to meet women. However instead of a simple no or lack of interest, most people begin to dislike me as they take my social ackwardness as a sign of malice.

At this point in my life I feel these problems are too ingrained to change and I really want to look for some long term solution.",,Depressed

When I bring the work up, he says that it is all to pay for my computer and bad attitude, although I paid for my pc and he already punishes me for bad behavior.

"The only thing I want.This is for you ""friend"",
I know that my “whims” to commit suicide always come at an inconvenient time to you. But I’ve been wanting and thinking of it since middle school and what? I’ve known you two years. So yeah, I ask for help and I know it’s a lot of pressure but telling me all the things I do wrong when I’m calling for your help does kinda make you another reason that I don’t want to live. No it is not your fault. But you should have just left me alone. But being a guilty asshole doesn’t fix me or make my panic attacks any less severe. I’ve been going to doctors because you asked me and taking medications because you said they made me better. I thought you wouldn’t feel pressured or guilty if you knew I was trying to fix things. I’ve run out of reasons not to do it. I was holding out for my mom but now she is gone. And now I’m just the kid who cried wolf because you don’t believe me when I tell you how much I want to die. You laugh and call me a worthless bitch and tell me to do it because you’re tired of hearing me saying it over and over and over. Well I am tied of saying it over and over and over. 

To everyone else,
This is what I want. Don’t you dare pitty me.
Maybe a small bit of me wants to do it to prove a point. That if you have enough people telling you all the things you will never be and all the things you ruin then yes, they will eventually snap and that will be the end of it. No more sorrys or just keep trying or things will get better. Just fucking silence. And not the aching emptiness I feel right now because that is still something. But actual emptiness. I want to cease to exist and melt into the emptiness. I know its right because when I think of it it’s the only time I feel okay.  I’m a mix of all the wrong things and I cant fix it. So the only sorry I’ll allow is that I’m sorry I cant live up to everyone’s expectations even my own and so I choose not to live.

"Happiness: The greatest sales pitch of all timeA man who committed suicide a few years ago left a parting note in a forum for those he cared about, where he described the human condition as one of stress, misery and drudgery, a slog from start to finish, citing happiness as a goalpost we can reach that instantly moves further away, and honestly since then i can't think of a better way to reason out the world as it is. We are not happy creatures, it's not our status quo, it's just a moment of elevated levels of dopamine and other chemicals our body releases, or from substances we ingest or inhale. Happiness is sold to us in bottles of pills and alcohol, shitty fast foods and cheap sex appeal, by people with more money, security and indulgences than we care to admit. We, the vast majority of people, have been conned into this stupid fucking mindset that things are supposed to be nice and pretty and where everyone gets along. Horseshit. We strive to work until we die for just enough money to exist and even then, the sick joke is that many cant even get the work. At this stage, i don't know whether to laugh, cry or wash my mouth out with both barrels of a 12gauge. Too sick of this shit to care any more and so bitter that i dont wanna kill myself for fear of missing those old fucks finally dying after messing with us so much.

"Severe Anhedonia and Social AnxietyI'm 21 going on 22 this coming April. Life is hard. Life is a disappointment. Life is boring. especially when I'm losing interest in everything I have ever found interesting - guitar, girls, music, movies, tv, food. The world seems really dark in this state, having nothing to live for and when I don't even care anymore if i lose everything i have right now. It's extremely tiring to just wake up from bed, get dressed and go to my part-time job. Sometimes i stay in the office an hour above required because I have no where to be.

Having social anxiety doesn't help. I pretend I'm fine everywhere i go with fake smiles and fake uplifting tones. When no one is looking i turn around and reveal my emotionless face. I have no reply when someone talks to me. My mind is blank. I'm tired. Tired of when I'm talking, my 'friends' may stop talking but they don't listen at all. They just continue on with their story and forget everything I said. I'm tired of this. I keep the around just so i don't feel embarrassed when i walk around alone. So I can tell my parents i have somewhere else to be rather than sit at home when I'm not at work.

I've attempted suicide before by overdose of pills but i was stopped by the police when one of my friends called them. Even then my parents don't understand.

The pills were from the local Mental institution for help me stabilise my mood. I hear voices in my head. They're not as bad as what some other people experience. Mine just talks to me. I wish they were actual real beings because the voices seem to care about me more than the real people around me.

My mom has been trying to help but it never works. He continues to do this, and I get nervous around him because of his outbursts.

One time he threatened to hit me. Scared out of my 12 year old mind.

I am now 16, a month away from 17. Just a few days ago, I said I didn't want to go run at a track club and instead go to the gym because I figured I'd like to work on more cross fit. There were insults and yelling, and then my sister told me he said he'd kill me, and he came into the basement and as I tried to go upstairs he grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. I told him to stop, he didn't, and I slipped out. I grabbed my charger and my phone and I sprinted into the garage, got my shoes and ran away full speed. I went to my friend's house shaking and we walked around until 1 in the morning, throwing rocks and sitting at the back of the school yard. That night, as we were going back to sleep at his house, I decided I was going to change my last name.

I hate that I have to have the same surname. 

When I get older, people will call me exactly what they called him. I hate him with a burning passion. I've decided that I'm going to change my last name to Kujo when I hit 18, and legally I won't need an adult. I'm disassociating with him. I just can't anymore.",,Anxious
"Labels can be dangerous Just a random 4am thought, scroll on. So I was reading some wiki article about humanism and anti humanism and a reddit thread about star trek's philosophy and it got me thinking about how labels can be dangerous to shaping our thoughts.

People like to label themselves, they could call themselves a humanist, a nihilist, an existentialist, a communist, a conservative, a democrat, an anarchist, etc. Even labels like 'outcast', 'stupid', 'the straight a student', etc.

And the problem with those labels is that people tend to get too attached to the label itself, trying to fit themselves into a box and forget how to think for themselves.

You call yourself a nihilist or an existentialist, and obess over the label itself. You try to fit into that description of a certain philosophy. And you forget how to question some aspects of your label, and truely think for yourself.

Perhaps this is a better example than the former paragraph. You treat people like they're idiots, and people will become one. You treat them like intelligent good people, and they'll strive towards becoming one.

I'm not saying certain labels are bad, but what I'm trying say is that those don't define you and sometimes you focus too much on those lofty ideals and you forget what's really important.",,Stressed

Theres nothing stopping them from going and kissing someone and telling me all about it and it fills me with so much anger and dread that I want to puke because I know that if they were going to get with anyone it isn't going to be me since even before I had feelings I knew that they loved someone else as much as I love them. I just want to keep them with me forever , to hold them in my arms and never let go. Everything in the world could burn down around me and as long as they were okay by the end of it all I'd be fine with it. Earlier on they made a joke about sending one of our friends Lewds and I hated it , outloud I told our friend to deny them or I'd be upset with him but I dont have any right to say that because the person I love doesnt belong to me or to anyone. At this point I think the only way I'm getting over them Is by pretending they dont exist for a while but since they can't handle anyone ignoring them or they shut down I can't do that , I want him to be happy more than I want my pain to stop but I just can't take it anymore , I just wish they were mine and mine alone , nobody else could have them , only me.

The reason I hate my jealousy so much is because I've got no right to be jealous, the person I have feelings for doesnt belong to me just because I love them , I'm not allowed to want them all to myself because that's selfish and I dont own them , but even as toxic and disgusting as it is it's still how I feel and I hate it , I want my skin to shrivel and dry up , it feels like its burning and I want it gone , I need a release somehow but I promised them that I woudln't self harm , I've only got pent up filthy and toxic feelings and no way to expel them so they just manifest and grow and mutate and I can't stand it anymore

I wish they loved me as much as I love them , i wish they realised how much I do love them , i wish they'd stop calling me a simp as a joke because it makes me feel like my love for them even without my indescribable jealousy is fake and superficial , it's not fake , it's how I feel , I dont want to have to forget about the feelings i have but i just dont want to be in pain like this anymore , I want the one I love more than anything to love me back even a little bit in the same way , 

If only I didnt promise not to hurt myself , if only i hadn't fallen in love , if only i didnt have my disgusting jealousy then itd all be okay",,Stressed

"I don't know how to startI don't know what to say. My life is so wonderful yet so terrible at the same time. I have a loving family who supports me for the most part (my dad has severe anger issues when he gets mad but I still love him because he's my father) I don't think my parents have a happy marriage though. It just seems kind of dull. We never do fun things as a family like we did when we were little. They try to get me to do family stuff with them yet I never want to, it just doesn't interest me anymore. I don't do anything bad. The only thing I ever get in trouble for is bad grades. I'll admit it I'm pretty lazy. I try to do good in school but I stop caring and I can't bring myself to care about my school work. I can't really bring myself to care about anything. I care about other people and I try to help everyone best I can, even just strangers online. But sometimes it feels like no one is there to help me when I need it. People come to me for support all the time and as soon as I need it from them they seem to just not care as if I'm not their problem. I can't talk to my parents about anything, my mom seems to be the only one who cares about my feelings. My dad doesn't really give a shit but it's okay I don't think he understands. Sometimes I think he feels the same way I do about everything except he hides it better. A few weeks ago I got my first job. Neither of my parents are working as of lately, just been living off my dad compensation for a work related injury. We've never had a lot of money and we almost lost our house (again) a few months ago. I've been with a girl I met online (I know online relationships don't tend to work out well but I really love her) for the past 7 months. It started really awesome but I think I've gotten to attached to her. I know she loves me and I know I love her but sometimes I feel like she doesn't even care about me. Sometimes we fight a lot too but other times things are perfect. I'm not unhappy with her, she's a really sweet and loving girlfriend. But sometimes it's just so hard to communicate about our emotions because of the distance and being afraid of what the other will think. Sometimes I think of breaking up with her even though I don't want to and neither does she. The only people who seem to care about me at all are my mom, my girlfriend, and a few online friends. My real friends have forgotten about me. I've also forgotten about them. In school I feel like a ghost so I just go on my phone most of the day. I don't pay attention I just scroll Instagram instead of doing My work. I always lie when asked about homework and say that I finish it in class but really I just don't do it. I got my third term report card two weeks ago and I failed 3 classes. That's the worst I've had since 7th grade (I'm a junior currently) and I'm afraid to show my parents. I know my dad would probably be the angriest I've ever seen. Back in middle school he used to hit me sometimes when I'd come home with a bad report card. He's not a bad man so when he would calm down he would apologize and talk it out.  He's ""addicted"" to weed. He's smoked everyday since he was my age. He's only happy when he's high. He doesn't know that I know this, I found his stash one day in our camper and told my mom. She broke down and started explaining to me all about it. It's upsetting. I don't look up to him as a father figure. To be honest I don't really have one from the feel of it. I look up to my mother for her kindness, nothing more than that as well. A few months back I started messing with pills to try to get high. I started taking my moms anti depressants and oh boy they made me feel great at first but slowly started to her weaker. One day I decided to take 8 doses. Didn't end well... then I start d playing with prescription ibuprofen that I found (800mg which is max allowed dose to be prescribed here) and it made me feel happy. Jumpy as hell but happy. The past few weeks I've been feeling really low but also kinda happy too. It's weird, I feel so shitty yet  feel like it doesn't matter. In a way I guess I just feel neutral, almost empty. And I hate it. I used to take methylphenidate and still have a lot left. I looked it up today and it's turns out the overdose is usually fatal and isn't a super high dose. I just don't want to do this anymore. I feel so pressured and overwhelmed by everything in my life. I've thought of running away from home. I always wanted to leave the state as soon as I graduate high school. What am I gonna do just keep running? Has to end somewhere right? So why bother? I just don't want to live like this anymore but I don't know how to fix it. To be honest I feel like I've become so absorbed that I can't. I think I'm gonna do it but I don't know.

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.' - Sheev Palpatine

"My girlfriend has gone MIA To start off, Im sorry if this post comes across as whiny, but I haven’t been in the best headspace lately. 

To start off, my gf and I have been together for around 7 months, and although we knew each other in school, our relationship really took off once the quarantine started. We spent almost all day and all night speaking to each other and as the stay at home orders were lifted in our state, we began to spend time together in person as well. 

Well as fate would have it, this wouldn’t last long, because for personal reasons, she would have to fly to Ecuador to stay with her family for a month. I’m not gonna pretend this didn’t hurt, but I didn’t want to make things about me, especially when she’s got so much going on in her life at the moment. 

Flash Forward to about 5 days ago, I’ve been trying my best to keep how I feel about her being gone to myself because again I don’t want her to feel guilty for something that’s not her fault, but for the sake of communication and not holding stuff in and maybe blowing up on her, I decided I should tell her about it. Surprisingly, it went pretty good she was understanding but the day after, I didn’t hear anything from her. That’s not that big a deal, she usually texts me late at night, anyway but once it hit the 48 hour I started getting paranoid. 

I texted her best friend to ask and see if she’s heard anything from her, and to my surprise she has, but she’s going through something right now, and is ignoring basically everyone including her family. I get it. But at the same time I wish I would’ve been given some notice or at least something saying “i need some space”. But I haven’t really had anything to go off of. Her best friend can’t even really tell me definitively if she’s planning on ghosting me, so I’m really just left up in limbo. I’m pretty confident I’m not being cheated on however, she’s seen in her own life the effects of it on a person, and I would at least hope she has enough respect for me to not subject me to that. 

Which leads me to now. I’ve been on the verge of a panic attack for like 3 days at this point, and the only thing that gives me a semblance of peace is the thought of her texting back. What’s going on with her is something that I probably don’t understand, but like I want to yk? I just want to see her happy again even if it’s not with me.

I'm tired of being the ""strong friend"". The past two weeks I tried being more open, I tried telling my friends what was going on, but they've got their own problems, how can I ask them for help, when I'm supposed to be the one who helps them ?  
I'm sorry if this sounds selfish, but I'm tired of trying to convince my friend its worth it to stay alive, and that she's loved, but she doesn't believe it.

But then that makes me hate myself even more because I'm a fucking hypocrite trying to talk others out of suicide, when I'm on the verge myself.

Then I can't ask for help because my friends need me, no one wants to see depressed, suicidal me, they want the funny, happy, me.

"Asian Lives Matter Too  It's been almost a year that the pandemic has started and this is the worst it has been. It's so bad. It really is and nobody will talk about it. As an Asian, I've known racist remarks and subtly condescending jokes all my life, but it has never been this bad. Now, it feels that no matter who you are, where you are, or what you're doing, being racist to ASIANS is somehow okay? I can't tell you the number of times people always use China as a method of analogy or some kind of support for the CLEARLY RACIST ARGUMENTS. Stuff like, ""Oh, but China didn't let Black people leave their country. Why should WE treat you like a human being."" It's always China did this, so you have to face my revenge racism. But the thing is, I AM NOT IN CHINA, I am AMERICAN, just like how you ARE NOT AFRICAN, MEXICAN, BRITISH, FRENCH, we are all AMERICAN. But for me, and all my friends as well, no matter where IN ASIA they are from, they always get the China argument.

And this is from all sides. Whites, Hispanics, AND African Americans, all have a part in this. This is not a single race issue, this is an AMERICAN issue. I don't know why I thought that my fellow People of Color would at least have my back, my mom's back, my family's back. Instead, I don't know, it seems that no one has our back? It's been tough and hard and a struggle to see your entire race being condoned to racism by the entire country.

They try to be subtle and try to spread their racism to others. Then it slowly turns into real violence, real acts of hate, but no news covers it. It really breaks your heart and makes you just want to do something, but you can't. There is realistically nothing Asians who make up barely 5 percent of the US population can do. Our votes don't matter, our voice doesn't matter, we don't matter. All we can do is struggle from oppression from all sides, all people. I'm scared for my family, my friends, and of course myself.

"My encounter with a Fer De Lance (one of the 10 deadliest snakes in north/central America) So I was on vacation in Costa Rica, and we were staying in a 75 foot tall tree house. And there was a pool, about a five minute walk from the treehouse. So on day 2 of the 7 day trip, I decide to go down to the pool. I grab my towel, sandals, and sunscreen, then continue to walk down the trail. My siblings and cousin were already at the pool, and I decide to explore (the pool was in a ravine) and my sister says “Don’t do it, you don’t know what’s out there, you might get hurt!” I look at her and say “Since when do you care about me?” And I jump down into the ravine. I look around, nothing interesting. I look at my feet, pretty nice pile of leaves next to my left foot. But that pile of leaves started *moving* and *hissing*, at this point I basically shat my soul out through my ears. I was paralyzed of fear. The snake looked me in the eye, I was thinking “*if I move, I’ll get bit, if I don’t move, I’ll get bit*” and I was panicking on the inside. My cousin looks over and says “Holy hell thats a snake! Help him out!” As he proceeds to grab a stick and slap the snake with it, directing the snakes vision towards him, I start running to the deck, and the snake bites at my heel, missing my shoe my centimeters. My cousin keeps poking it to distract it, the snake bites the stick and hold on, my cousin runs with the stick and sets it down about 40 feet away from where we were. My brother grabbed my cousins phone and took a picture of the snake, and after we got up to the tree house, we told our parents what happened. My mom started freaking out and my uncle was impressed and mad at my cousins actions. My uncle wanted to ground my cousin for poking the snake with a stick, but decided not to because he saved my life. My mom just said “I’m glad you’re okay” and that’s it. We showed the photo of the snake to the property owner and he said “Oh yea, that’s a Fer De Lance, if you were bit, and went untreated for two hours, you’d be dead.” So I was extremely grateful for my cousin.


So, Jacob, thank you for having balls of steel, or else I’d be dead.",,Anxious

"because i saw this somewhere else, here Chaotic Reid Salvatore  


## A Short Storyby ooga booga

Sox Dubois was thinking about Reid Salvatore again. Reid was a chaotic giant with thick dicks and skinny legs.

Sox walked over to the window and reflected on his quiet surroundings. He had always hated bright london with its rotten, roasted rivers. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel angry.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather some*one*. It was the a chaotic figure of Reid Salvatore.

Sox gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a honest, strict, monster drinker with blonde dicks and tall legs. His friends saw him as a green, giant goblin. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved a spluttering kitten.

But not even a honest person who had once jumped into a river and saved a spluttering kitten, was prepared for what Reid had in store today.

The hail pounded like skipping panthers, making Sox happy. Sox grabbed a purple book that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Sox stepped outside and Reid came closer, he could see the disgusted glint in his eye.

Reid gazed with the affection of 8614 annoying clumsy cats. He said, in hushed tones, ""I love you and I want dick.""

Sox looked back, even more happy and still fingering the purple book. ""Reid, why are you gay,"" he replied.

They looked at each other with homicidal feelings, like two long, loopy lions cutting at a very haywire funeral, which had alt music playing in the background and two disorganized uncles crying to the beat.

Suddenly, Reid lunged forward and tried to punch Sox in the face. Quickly, Sox grabbed the purple book and brought it down on Reid's skull.

Reid's thick dicks trembled and his skinny legs wobbled. He looked suicidal, his emotions raw like a cuddly, condemned car.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Reid Salvatore was dead.

Sox Dubois went back inside and made himself a nice drink of monster.",,Stressed

Bellow this point i will paste results of some free psyho tests (i know that they are probably shit, but they give something at least)

There is no clear indication that you might have a

psychopathic / antisocial personality disorder.

You reached, however, 50,00% of Factor 1 which captures the core personality traits of psychopathy that define the interpersonal and affective deficits of this personality disorder (e.g. shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, lack of empathy) and that are correlated with narcissistic personality disorder, low anxiety, low empathy, low stress reaction and low suicide risk. But Factor 1 is also associated with extraversion and positive affect - affected persons usually score high on scales of achievement and well-being, so some aspects of the personality disorder may even be beneficial for the psychopath (in terms of nondeviant social functioning or if it comes to profit from manipulation or lies).

You reached, however, 22,22% of Factor 2 which captures the traits of antisocial behavior (e.g. criminal versatility, impulsiveness, irresponsibility, poor behaviour controls, juvenile delinquency) and is associated with reactive anger, social deviance, sensation seeking, anxiety, increased risk of suicide, low socio-economic status, criminality, and impulsive violence.

You reached, however, 100,00% in other relevant traits that can indicate this personality disorder.

You might have certain traits of antisocial or psychopathic personalities but certainly not in a form that would justify a personality disorder diagnosis according to the standards.

Score: 16 of 38 \[16:8/4/4\]

&amp;#x200B;

There are strong indications that you might have a

narcissistic personality disorder.

There are slight differences between the major diagnostic manuals in how to diagnose a narcissistic personality disorder, with the ICD-10 manual stating that a person may only be diagnosed with a Narcissistic Personality Disorder if she/he does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a dissocial (antisocial, psychopathic), histrionic or any of the other personality disorders at the same time. For the DSM-IV manual, there is no such exclusion. It is unusual for NPD personality types to seek therapy, as they unconsciously fear exposure or inadequacy and will usually disdain therapeutic processes or the idea of psychotherapy itself, sabotage the therapeutic process or openly oppose it. Pharmacotherapy is rarely effective.

Score: 5 of 9

&amp;#x200B;

There is no indication that you might have a histrionic personality disorder.\[D:4/I:3\]

&amp;#x200B;

You meet 100% of the range of general personality disorder criteria.

This further indicates that you might have to deal with a severe personality disorder.

Thus, is strongly recommended you seek a professional diagnosis to be sure what exactly you are dealing with.

It might turn out useful to print the previous page including your selections and take it to a psychotherapist, psychiatrist or psychologist.\[G:5\]

"I feel disconnected from the real world.I have lived 23 years (though that's not my true, inner age), but I still live at home. I am a full-time student and have a part-time online job that only pays enough to cover what tuition I owe after pell grants and scholarships. I have no sort of ambition or interest in the real world, my real life. I spend all day fantasizing about dead celebrities and aching over how badly I wish to befriend them. I play a lot of video games and spend a significant amount of time researching topics that won't necessarily have any use in a career. I rarely leave my room and can't remember the last time I left my house.

I'm experiencing anxiety about returning to school next week. I hate it there. I like what I'm studying, but I hate being around other people in a classroom setting. It makes me super uncomfortable. It makes me feel trapped, stifled, and out of control. I swore to myself after high school that I would never put myself through that hell again, but last year reality decided to pay me a short-lived visit and I realized I would never have a chance in life if I didn't go to college and get a degree. The thing is, I have no desire to work or have a career of any kind–I just figure that if it's a choice between some blue collar, manual labor job or something I'm at least somewhat interested in and will make me better money, I'll go with the latter. I've always been a good student (quite above average, actually), but believe me when I say I do NOT like school. I only push myself to succeed because 1) I feel like most of what little self-worth I have is tied to my academic success, and 2) I understand that I won't get anywhere in life if I just flunk out of everything.

I'm aromantic-asexual, which means I don't feel romantic or sexual attraction to anyone. As a result, I feel extremely isolated and lonely. I think a big misconception about people like us is that we don't want love or relationships–not true. We just don't want the kind of love that's like, ""Omg, I want to date you and have sex, blah, blah..."" I would really love to have a mentor type adult figure, but I can't find anyone like that. Every adult in my life treats me like one of them, even though I'm not. I'm transage, meaning that although I've lived 23 years, my inner age hasn't matured past about 14. It causes me more distress than you can imagine to know that I will never receive the type of love I so desperately long for. I hate myself and feel like such shit every day for being emotionally deprived.

It might sound insane, but I'm not jealous of my celebrity platonic crush's wife, but of any potential future granddaughters he might have. He has no female descendants as of yet, but I realize there is still time for that to change. Yes, I know it's crazy, but I literally would be jealous of him having a little girl. It's a huge fear of mine. I want to be his little princess that he spoils and protects. Not his literal daughter or granddaughter, as I'm happy with my own family, but you get the gist. That kind of relationship, more or less. Again, I have no desire whatsoever to be with him in a romantic sense, so this isn't a typical ""crush"" in that I want to marry him or anything in the afterlife, but instead be his little friend. You know the kind of relationship Jacob has with Renesmee in the Twilight books? That sort of thing.

Like I said, I really don't have any goals or dreams in life. It's basically just going through the motions for me because I feel like I have no other choice. My only true heart's desire is to have animals and to meet my celebrity platonic crush in heaven. But the animal dream isn't enough to make me want to stay on this earth; to have to endure a lifetime of working outside the home, suffering, and emotional isolation. There is nothing I look forward to. I feel tired and sluggish most days, filled with anxiety over the next time I have to leave the house.

The thought of having to function in the real world as the adult I'm NOT makes me sick and full of dread. Even if I did have career goals, I would still be a transage freak who will never have her ""Jacob."" Simply put, I wasn't meant for this planet, and I'm starting to finally accept that. I feel like I'm one of those people that would seriously just be better off dead. I'm not happy here, and I'm tired of the pain.",,Depressed

"Kung Fu Panda is very underrated When people talk about good animation films the same always come up, shrek, toy story... But I do think Kung Fu Panda is the best one.

The musical theme is great (not the everybody was kung fu fighting song). 

The themes of the movies are also very good. Finding yourself, family, and fate. In the first film the villain escapes because they send a messenger fearing that he is going to escape. In the second the villain makes his own fate truth by attacking the pandas.

It also has some nice fighting and training scenes.

"I just ordered an x-acto knife on Amazon.I've been constantly thinking about it all week. I tried to go to the store and buy one, but the only one I could build courage up to go to didn't have it

It's all I think about sometimes. I've tried to kill myself with pills before, almost 3 years ago. But I woke up in the hospital. 

I've always felt so hallow, since that first attempt. Like a part of me really did die that day. I still believe maybe, if there is such a thing, that my soul died and I'm just an empty shell. Nothing inside me but a black, empty nothingness. 

I remember feeling that hole fill up. Almost completely. But lately it's stirring, swirling like a vortex and gutting me like a pumpkin.

Yet I maintain a 40 hour a week job. This past two weeks I have been awful to the people I work with, which makes it all worse. 

I hate my job, I hate that I'm still trying to rebuild my life THREE YEARS since the first attempt. I hate that I could have been on a better path where I was successful and not suffering. I hate that I can be happy and forget all about all of this over a weekend  and then return to reality when I go back to my shitty job and hate life again.


I have thought about going back on medication and have attempted to see my original doctor and make a set up and new one. But the waits and waiting lists make me uneasy.  But really though, I am ashamed to be on meds. I am afraid to be on meds. I'm just so tired and have no motivation to do anything. Because it's all in my head. It's all so draining.


I'm just tired. So tired. Physically, mentally and in my chest I feel that I am not meant to be happy.

"I’m too complex...I have been living with anxiety and panic attacks for over a decade. I first started using mental health services at the age of 9. I’m now 23. I grew up with a very dysfunctional family. I was physically and emotionally abused by my mum and her partner after she divorced my dad. I was also neglected by both of them. I recently learnt about this a couple of weeks ago after reading my medical notes and I haven’t been able to come to terms with it. I confronted my mum about it and she told me that I shouldn’t be making such claims and that it wasn’t true. I ended my relationship with her right there. I suffer from horrific health anxiety, day in and day out worrying that I’m going to drop down dead every time I get a pain or discomfort. I spend most of my time in the house because shops make me panic and so do open spaces so I can’t go to a park or the beach for a walk. I have no friends because they all left me because of my mental health issues. I have been emotionally abused by every partner I have ever had and I’ve been sexually assaulted many times. I have a lovely boyfriend now but I’m worried I’m ruining it because we can’t do anything nice together and all I do is worry and tell him my worries. And to top it off...I might have a personality disorder. I am being investigated for BPD. But the thing that makes this even more complex is...it’s either a personality disorder or a gender issue. I have a character I created that I become to help me through anxiety but it turns out I actually enjoy being him and I have started to have very intense dysphoria around my female body. But apparently BPD and gender issues are very similar. I feel like I’m just a complex case and that I will never find out what is really going on with me. And, if it is a gender issue I won’t want to transition because of my health anxiety. I feel like my life is just stuck in a cycle of worry, worry, worry and I’m tired of it. I created a new backstory for myself and even created a new family for myself in my head. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

My grandfather who i love and cherish probably more than my life has some disorder from the parkinson family of disorders. The disorder is slowly killing his muscles he is losing all his mobility and control over his body, every day he falls in the last 2 months he had 2 falls resulting in fatal head injury and he fell again yesterday and this was a gruesome one, and today i was sitting with him he started talking about his will and stuff after him and it was so hard not to breakdown into a crying mess it was like yesterday this man was giving me piggyback rides and taking me on long drives at 3am because I couldn't sleep. We would laugh together cry together, gobble up liters of ice cream and sweets, working around in his garden playing. And today he can't stand up without someone holding him he can't speak without choking on his own spit he can't eat without the food spilling all over him.

"I may as wellA girl I was close to in Hospital, who I last saw ten days ago, was able to kill herself in the psychiatric ward. They weren't looking after her properly, when I was there I had to stop her from killing herself. 

She kissed me and it was kind of awkward but I cuddled her anyway because it was nice, she was nice and she wanted a cuddle. When I didn't want to cuddle much anymore the last few days I was there because I was feeling agitated, I hope she didn't see it as a rejection. 

I never had anyone I know kill themselves before. It hurts. She was so sad, and now she's dead. I've only known for 4 hours and the image of her dead body keeps popping into my head. Our interactions pop into my head. How I might have hurt her and how absent my emotions were at the time popped into my head.

I want it to stop now",,Depressed

"How should I tell my parents I am going to die.I posted this on advice, but unsurprisingly nobody gave a shit and like 2 people just replied telling me to go to the doctor. I figure you guys think about this stuff a lot and so might be able to help me.

Ive been depressed for &gt;10 years so im quite looking forward to dying to be honest, im just worried about my parents.


I’m fairly certain I have throat cancer. Ive been smoking unfiltered cannabis cigarettes with tobacco for like 10 years, ive been hoarse and had a lump on my throat for longer than 6 months. I don’t care that I have cancer but im really worried about telling my parents. They’re both depressed because they are in shitty financial situation since my dad had to stop working because of chronic back pain. One of out cats went missing and then was found dead several weeks later last year and they both fell to pieces and mourned the cat for weeks. I really don’t want them to do anything stupid when I tell them but im worried they will. I feel terrible because I know this will ruin their lives. I haven’t even been to the doctors because I am worried the doctor will tell them. Also I don’t want to die in a hospital bed I want to die at home with my cats and I don’t want to spend the last days I have where I can be active feeling shitty because chemo and I really don’t want to spend the rest of my life with a hole in my throat, I’d rather be dead. Overall im ambivalent about dying which makes me feel even worse for doing this to my parents.

"I told my friend I loved her.... and she loves me back! We're both over the moon. So in some of my posts here I've mentioned this one friend I have, who is a very sweet and wholesome girl I know. I usually give her the pseudonym Jules when I talk about her here. For years we've had a very close platonic friendship, but I realized a few weeks ago that she and I would be a great couple. Today, I finally pulled the trigger, but not after a mishap. Last week, I sent her a message saying ""Hey, we haven't called for a while. It would be nice to hear your voice"" and on Saturday we talked. But I got cold feet and didn't bring it up. I regretted it immediately after I hung up. The next day I said that there was something big I wanted to tell her about, but that I chickened out about and didn't bring it up. She said we could talk about it next time that we call and not to worry. We planned to call again next weekend (our schedules have both been packed lately). On Sunday night I told myself that everything would be fine. I have a whole week to get ready.

When I woke up today, I just wanted to tell her and get it over with.... the idea of waiting 6 more days was not fun at all! So I typed up a big message telling her what I felt and what I thought the two of us could have together. I sent it to her on Discord and then sent her a bunch of snaps telling her that I couldn't wait to tell her about that big thing.... check your discord!

Hours later, I get a snapchat video back from her. She told me that the letter I wrote was the sweetest thing anybody had ever done for her. And after a few seconds of just being speechless, she said: ""I'm gonna say it.... I kinda like you too.""

She asked for a few hours to think about it. Two and a half hours later, she texts me. She says she would love to be my girlfriend. We already have pet names for each other (querido/querida, which means ""dearest"" or ""missed"" or ""wanted"" in spanish depending on how you translate it). We are so excited to take our friendship to the next level. I've told a few of our friends and they are all happy for us too.

I wouldn’t call my household abusive, but I don’t want to live here.

Its just a constant cycle of.. everything- and if I have to live through one more fucking day of it I swear to god I will snap and kill everyone around me and then myself. The only thing stopping me is an available method, which is probably just whatever higher power’s way of adding to whatever hell has been created for me.

They will be the happiest people and the most giving. the softest and the kindest and the one in any given relationship to try the hardest because they dont want to break again and dont want the other person broken.

"A Guy on Snap I added 3 years ago scares me even today. 

I need help. 

I met a guy online and added him on snap when i was 16. He was cute and all that. But he kept asking for pictures (you know what i mean). He traumatised me. He kept forcing me into a relationship, manipulating me for more. 

My common sense snapped back eventually.  I told him a firm no. and then came the emotional blackmailing about spreading my pictures online. I blocked him, deleted snap and tried my best to forget about the fiasco.

A few months later, he contacted me on the site we met again. I blocked him there as well. He made other members on there text me to add him back and at least let him apologise. Big mistake. His apologies were a blackmail to get me back. Else, he threatened he would send screenshots of our chat on instagram to my partner who I am in a great relationship with. I didn’t want my partner to get dragged into this at the time, and with a little support and help from one of my friends, I blocked him everywhere possible.

It has been over a year to that now. There’s been no contact whatsoever. I’m happy but still so fucking worried that he might just come into my life and blackmail me. People have reassured me that nothing scary is going to happen but I am so so scared. I don’t even know what his real name and age is.

"I have no reason to stay. I’m going to be gone by the end of this month.I don’t know how to say it. But might as well try to get it out before I’m gone. 

I’ve been in a relationship with an amazing guy for about two years, but we broke up recently. He told me he didn’t love me the way he used to anymore, and it was after I opened up to him about how suicidal I was. 

I had been practicing for an audition for a month and almost passed, but unforeseen circumstances and the cruel world betrayed me as usual and I’ve got nothing left. 

I have terrible grades. I am in the top class in my school, but I don’t even know how I got in there because my scores are in the lower half of the class. All my classmates hate me, but I don’t know what I did wrong. 

I had aspired to become a doctor, but I don’t know what for. Everyone around me is so cruel that I can’t bring myself to think I’ll have to save their lives in the future. Also, we’re all going to die anyway; why try to make them live longer if the world’s such a hellhole?

I tried to kill myself on Tuesday. I wrote a suicide letter and drank a bunch of pills. I lay down in my bed, ready for death to welcome me in its arms. But I woke up. I cried because I couldn’t do anything right — not even dying. 

I can’t trust anyone anymore. I’m just a burden on everyone and I can’t take it. 

I have no friends nor anyone that truly cares about me. I have no reason to stay.

"It's overI am tired of living. My life has been shit since I was a child losing my parents when I was 5 then living with family who kept me in the crawl space and beat me daily. After 18 I was away from them and things seemed to be getting better but the depression was always there and still nightmares of the past. Everyone on the outside had no clue what I been through or that I was down. I faked being happy almost my whole life. Now I'm 27 and tired of it. Always was living paycheck to paycheck until I was about 24 and started making good money and had over 30k in the bank which was satisfying to me and in the best spot of my life. But then life happened again and with no family I was staying in hotels for nearly half a year straight the past year and blew through all my savings. Back to being as broke as I was before all the depression just came back and hit me hard. I feel lifeless like nothing in my life matters. I have to pay 700 in rent at the end of the month and have no way to pay it. Told my roommate I would pay 500 but have no way of even doing that. Basically a situating where I will be out on the street and I feel the sense of urgency beating on me strong.  I literally have no family or friends to help me. The thing is I helped people a lot when I had money and was doing good and those so called friends disappeared when the money was running out. Last friend I thought I had a few weeks ago blocked me and disappeared after helping with 500 he needed. I only had 1000 to my name and thought he would pay back but nope blocked me right after that and was gone. I feel like an idiot and really don't wanna go on with this kind of stress any longer. I'm too embarrassed at this point to tell my roommate I can't come up with the money since I was already warned I would have to leave if I didn't have it, so I think I will off myself sometime before May. I know it sounds petty but the thought of failing anymore and even saying I don't have the money makes me want to die. Call me weak minded but I been through so much in my life I feel like I lived forever. Guess I just wanted someone to know my story.",,Depressed

"My love, Nate, I'm giving up - I'm sorryPrenote:  I apologize in advance for a lack of formatting and rambling and the fact I haven't verified my account or anything.  I don't plan on staying long. 


I'm a nineteen year old female who lives with her mother, although I wish otherwise. I've been in the fostercare system twice but was returned back home as I was sixteen the first time, seventeen the next.  

The first time was because I took a bottle of pills to school and overdosed in an attempt to kill myself in the girls bathroom that no one usually used.  I was taken to the ER and given charcoal to drink in my barely conscious state.  (Somehow charcoal liquefied nullifies such) CPS came and decided since they had been in my life several times before, I would be taken to a place that's a holder for teenagers who are too mentally unstable or too old to be in a normal home.

Second, me and mother fought.  She called the police and I was again, put in a placement (as it's called).  I was returned home at age eightteen.  

When I returned home, I was gifted with a gaming system and the news we'll be losing the house.  I waited. I asked ""Mum, can I get an ID?"" She never took me to get an ID.  I wanted to work, so we could at least eat a bit better.  As time went on, I secluded myself in my room.  I hated myself, constantly crying then going numb.  My depression was worse than it had ever been and I cut again for the first time in 5 years.  Mum started encouraging me to kill myself, along with her but I have to go first.  

I stuck to this gaming system and made friends.  I grew to care about them, where I don't even care about myself.  I had a few friend groups over time but as things go, they fell apart so no surprise.  

Fast forward a bit, I made a new friends group and am dating one of the members.  He knows most of what's going on.  What NO ONE ever knew was mum had us living in filth.   I mean absolute filth.  I couldn't even shower and I wanted to.  I felt disgusting.  I felt pathetic.  I cut.  It was relief.

Now we're in a motel, me and mum.  On the 28th, from my understanding, if Salvation Army doesn't help get housing by then, we'll be in our car.  My DID is out of control, my anxiety is 24/7, and the cigarette smoke is giving me asthma attacks.  I'm still being told to kill myself and I'm giving in.  I've needed to go to the hospital for a menstrual issue for over two weeks and I'm scared.  Nothing is getting done and I have no hope left.  I've been through too much and there's more I haven't typed as I've wasted your time more than enough.  

I only hope my love will forgive me for not hugging him in person like we planned. 

Forgive me babu.

"I'm tired of fighting.For the last few years I have been in a job that has deeply affected me. I spent many years in school and in training to do what I do. Along the way I encountered many setbacks but overcame them by persisting and pushing myself to do better. 

I took a job far away from home that made me separate from my wife for a long time. Longer than we expected. This nearly destroyed my marriage. At the same time, the people at this job are incredibly sleazy and are always lying and stabbing me in the back. It has made it so I can't really make myself work hard anymore. 

I resolved to give up. Try getting a new job, doing something else. This hurts, because I didn't do anything wrong. I worked hard. I got attention in the right ways, but ultimately I go fucked.

"I felt like a girl So something kinda funny, but also a bit creepy happened to be last evening. Long story short, my mom sold a cake for this girl's 18th birthday (let's call this girl Martha) and while handing it over joked how she should have sent me, since I'm also 18. Later one, while I was with my girlfriend, Martha sends me a message on insta.

At first the message was pretty normal. She told me to congratulate my mom on the amazing cake, nothing weird. Then she started joking how it's a shame I wasn't there to hant it over. That's when I became suspicious. Then I saw that Martha's friend posted a story that said ""Martha is looking for a boyfriend hahahahaha""

At that point there was no doubt about it. My girlfriend wanted me to just tell her I'm taken, but that felt too direct and rude and also I was afraid I might be wrong and it's a coincidence. I ended up more or less just leaving her on seen.

Later one, I saw she sent me a video. I knew from her stories she was a drunk because she was celebrating her birthday. She sent me a video where one of the figurines that was one the cake is beheaded with text that said ""this will be you if you leave me on seen hahahahaha."" Of course I knew she was drunk so i didn't see it as a serious treath so I sent her a message saying ""this is a threat and i doubt my girlfriend likes it...""

"There is no hope, and I’m just ready to be done with it all.Long story short, my 13 yo daughter has suffered from suicidal ideation for three years, I have tried to do everything and anything to help her (she’s been in therapy for as long), and to protect her, and to be a good mom to her (by always listening and being open and talking to her, amongst loads of other ways I’ve tried to be a good mom and do the right things by my children), but I reckon I’ve been shit because I’ve just found some very disturbing things that she’s into (she’s a writer and writes fan fiction that is straight up sex smut). I also reckon I’m shit because I want to kill myself because *there is no hope*.

I’ve suffered from suicidal ideation since I was about her age, too, but my father died when I was 11, so, I was quickly dx’d, but not helped very much. The only thing that kept me alive was 1) not knowing what happens after death 2) my mom finding my dead body (or having to identity it). I have 3 children and for the past few years, my suicidal thoughts have disappeared (FINALLY), but now they’re back because... I just have no hope. I also recently found out that’s she’s been hearing voices, and idk how to deal or cope with any of these things and FUCK! I have no hope. The last two years have been absolute SHIT. Not with her, but with a myriad of things and now they’re just getting worse and I don’t think I can live not being able to help her. I’m a shit fucking mom. Why the FUCK was I allowed to have children??? They deserve so much better. I hate myself. I hate that I’m this fucking weak. I hate that I can’t figure out what to do to help her. I just want to help her and I can’t. I’m useless. She’s seeing a psychiatrist next week, before you ask. They wouldn’t see her this week because I sent her out of state to be with my mom thinking it might help her to get a change of scenery. Who am I kidding? I thought it’d help her to get away from me.

"I don't know what to do anymore, I don't think there are any other options.Hello SW, I'm sorry for this very long story. I just think that you guys need the full story, every bit of it.  I am using a throwaway because I have another account but it would defeat the purpose of me telling you if I uploaded on there. Everything I am just about to tell you is true. I don't know how much more I can take so I decided my finale and only option is coming here. If anything just to get it off my chest for a little while. I appreciate everyone who will read this full thing I really do. So let me just post a TL;DR: Girlfriend is ready to ruin my life and I don't think there are any other options. 

Anyway so lets begin in the beginning, it was my birthday 8/15/10. I turned 14 on that day. I get a call from a girl I was admiring, who called me and asked me out. Of course I said yes, I mean a date for a birthday present? That's awesome right? Well lets call her Manderz which is her nickname. We start dating, and everything is going great! She takes my Virginity at the 3 month mark. I know, I know, I was young and she was 15. But Teenage Hormones am I right? So we are sexually active for the months to come. 

At the 8 month mark, she gets pregnant. We keep it a secret naturally, and we decide to get a abortion which was free because she has Indian blood in her. From that moment on I had the fear of pregnancy, like a extreme anxiety fear. We were stupid and  
shit happened. We both became depressed her especially, we were rocky for several months but through helping each other back we became somewhat happy again. nothing really happens before or right after I turn 15, even through the school year which was my freshmen year.

Then the summer after that school year, is when everything went wrong. in June of 2012 We had a pregnancy scare, me being human, and a scared teenager I said if she kept the baby I would leave her. Even at the time I knew I wouldn't but my fear talked for me. I apologized 10 minutes afterwards. But that was the worse mistake of my life. From that moment on she constantly reminds me of what I said, and I beg her to forgive me, I apologized almost everyday for months after I said that Telling her I wasn't going to. I would never do something like that.

Anyway let's move to the present. as in the last 5 or so months. I might be missing something from then to now, but I'm not thinking clearly so I apologize. Recently she has taken her telling me, to a whole new level. Now before I say this, I want to explain that my Mother is very laid back. She was fine when she found out about us having sex, and a really REALLY chill person. My father is a great man. Working in Saudi Arabia, for a oil company. He is smart not really strict, and one of the most respectful people I have ever known. But as he only gets to come home every three or so months he has a habit of thinking of me as maybe younger as I am. 

Let me explain, me being a teenager with a wallet, carried a condom with me. I would never use this condom, because it was always in my wallet and I don't have to explain what happens to a condom in a wallet. Anyway A friend gave me that when I was 14. So I just carried it around as a lucky charm. As I said, Immature teenager. So One night my mother was doing laundry and I left my wallet in the pants she was washing. the condom fell out in the drier and my dad was with my mom when she took them out and saw it there. He was furious and yelled at me telling me if he ever saw something like that again then I would ""see wraith of him that I have never seen before.""


I am now currently 16, and now finally he says if I ever had sex ALWAYS wear a condom. Back to Manderz 5 or so months back we had a rather nasty fight. And she threatened she would tell my dad about everything. I thought she couldn't till she reads my dads email out to me. Somehow she knew my email address password. I nearly shit myself and apologized for the argument I didn't start. Okay so one threat? We all make something like that some point in our lives. Well that isn't the case, every time I did something from that moment on, she threatened me with that. Even when I changed my password she told me that she wrote it down. So since then I have had this fear and growing depression even more so then before growing in my chest. Then one day she topped that. She told me she had screen caps of our convos about when she got an abortion and screencaps about me telling her about leaving her. I went into an anxiety attack flipped and fell into a fettle position and cried myself to sleep many nights thinking about what if she did it? My greatest fear exposed for everyone to see, friends, family, enemies. Everyone would know my past. She has made this threat several times to either get me to do something she wants, or because I made her mad.

Now with everything about this building up inside you can imagine I have changed, I used to be a happy kid, a strong leader in band, and a easy person to get along with. But with these constant bombardments  of threats it has made me a depressed, shy, and a very hard person to talk too. Tonight she has told me that she will start smoking pot, getting shit faced, and smoking cigs, and if I have a problem with it She will show everyone those screen caps. well I don't want to offend anyone, but I do not like smoking at all. My brother smokes, my uncle smokes, I hate it. I hate everything about it. I am fine with people doing it, I don't care. But if I am to be in a relationship with someone I need someone I am compatible with, and I am not compatible with a smoker. That almost pushed me over the edge, but the one thing that has almost if not certainly drove me to suicide is the fact that, she told me if I dump her she will show everyone. 

I am trapped in this relationship with a mental abuser and I have no other way out. My future looks bright, straight A's and B's, Going to Washington D.C. for a Law and CSI Leadership program. Great friends, great family. Expect for Manderz. Though I have much in front of me she has the power to ruin all of it. Every single bit. She has almost driven me to madness and made me suicidal. I needed someone to talk to and I figured Reddit, the Site I love would at least listen to my story. Thank you to all that has read this far, thank you. At least being able to write this and actually telling someone makes me feel a little bit better, for a little longer.  ",,Depressed

"I don't knowI don't really know how to start this off, but I'm planning on rehearsing jumping off a bridge. I don't exactly want to die right now, but I've had suicidal ideation for almost as long as I can remember and I feel like I need to do something about it. I've been going through a really tough time with my mental health this year, and now that I'm on the upswing I feel like I don't really want to get better. I don't want a job. I don't want friends. I don't want to go out. I don't want to do anything. I told my therapist about this yesterday and she didn't seem too concerned. I also feel like I'm getting signs that this is something I should do. 

In my town we have a large ""suicide bridge"", but I don't want to jump off that quite yet because I'm not sure how I would feel after I let go, and I'm not even too sure that I really want to die. I'm thinking of jumping off a smaller bridge to test the waters (pun intended) and see if I feel regret when I let go. I'm fairly certain that I would survive the fall, but the fact that I might not is appealing. My reservations are as follows:

1) I'm worried I might be doing it for attention, or that my family will think I'm doing it for attention. On a certain level I think I am, because my family doesn't believe there is anything wrong with me mentally. They just think I'm lazy and that I'm using my illnesses as a way to make myself seem ""special"", which I'm obviously not. If I could choose to be healthy I would, but they don't believe me. It makes me furious, and although I love them I really want to stick it to them for treating me this way for so long. I feel horrible saying that, but that's how it is.


2) I'm worried that I'll be a burden (or a danger) to the cars crossing the bridge, or that I'll be taking resources away from people who are 100% gung ho about killing themselves when I'm only testing it out. And, 


3) I'm worried I'll be put in the hospital and won't be allowed to leave. 

My main issue is that I don't want to be attention seeking, I truly want to know how I'd feel. I'm thinking of going around sunrise so not too many people are out and I wouldn't have to swim to shore in the dark. I don't know what I'm exactly looking for here, I guess I just wanted to put this out there and see what other people think. ",,Depressed

There was nothing wrong at this time; she had gone to bed which was why she didn't answer. She made it clear I had done wrong and I feel dreadful.

I know that by calling took a risk on our trust. I can tell she instantly went back to refusing to be open, dodging all questions, etc. She says she needs time and I respect that entirely.

"This is troubling me, I need help So my friend Sarah is 14, and she has an online friend who is 19. The 19 year old is named Dustin and he is about to turn 20. He has been saying some questionable things to her on discord, and fishy stuff has been going on. 11 days after she broke up with her ex, she revealed that her and Dustin were dating. Dustin kept saying “love is love” and that they were a furry couple. No, this is bullshit I’m breaking you two up. So that’s what I did. I broke them up. They still act like they are together though, I’m worried he will do something to Sarah. Sarah recently said she is “grounded” when really I have seen her online with Dustin in roblox and steam and stuff. Dustin did something to make her get over her ex in just a week, and made her want him more than all her other friends. At first I blamed this on jealousy “maybe I’m just jealous”. But no, something weird is going on. Idk whether it’s right to call him a pedo yet or not though. Sarah also got mad at me when I mentioned her and Dustin’s relationship and she said I “took that away from her”. Dustin also blocked me on every website or platform we know eachother on. Me and my friend Morris seem to be the only ones thinking something weird is going on, everyone else we know on discord said they were completely fine with when they were dating, and fine with all the questionable things Dustin said. I feel as if he is aware that he is (what I think) a pedophile. I called him one before, and he got pissed at me and said “don’t call me that” and that he has history with that word. That obviously means something. Idk, I’m just worried about her and all. I might just be getting corrupted by jealousy.

I don't know what to do, I told myself I could be different. College just started, I thought I could just make myself be more social and interact with people more.

Nope, that was futile. I can't do it. All I do is worry and nitpick every little thing I do because I constantly feel like everyone is judging me, and even though I know they're not, that thought doesn't exactly help to counteract the initial one.


Really, I don't even know I'm telling you guys this. I probably don't even have the balls to go through with it. It probably won't get better, I probably won't make any friends this year, and I probably won't even kill myself.

"For those struggling with anxiety; a personal collection of anti-anxiety tips As time went by I collected for myself a short list of things that can help with anxiety (both long term and situational) and I'd like to share it, maybe you'll find it helpful too.

`
Quick highlights of general tips:

long term:

1. Sleep long - sorts emotions + other benefits

2. Meditate (although significant benefits not proven)

3. Exercise - consistency &gt; intensity or duration

4. Live in the moment

5. Limit sugar, refined carbohydrates, caffeine

7. Protein rich breakfast -&gt; blood sugar doesn't drop so quickly

8. Keep urself hydrated

9. EAT BREAKFAST

10. Get up always at the same time (doesn't matter when you go to sleep)

________________________________________

situational:

1. Don't get hungry, keep a snack - blood sugar would drop -&gt; release stress hormon cortisol

2. Get warm - alters neural circuits &amp; serotonin

3. DEEP breathing - 3 in (pause) 3 out / 4-7-8

4. Hug - releases oxytocin

5. nap - sorts emotions

6. exercise

7. Shout/punch/release emotions

8. Dance

9. anti-anxiety songs (scroll down)

10. Hot shower -&gt; benefits of warmth + pressure combined

11. Massage - if not full body, hands massage (with a creme) or hair massage is good -&gt; releases endorphins

12. Put head below heart (may not work)

14. Splash cold water on your face - initiates diving reflex -&gt; slows down heartbeat -&gt; suppresses fight&amp;flight

15. Eat something, fat or protein is best
`

Spotify album for the songs:

Apart from this, trance works too (has a specific effect on brain).
______________________________________

I'd specifically like to point out that effects of meditation may be really very small compared to other things you can do (e.g. exercise).

I always treated anxiety as a a separate entity - a fucking idiot that I (as the confident and rational young man that I am) am not willing to submit to, so I'm fighting against him :D

A thing that I personally want to work on now is improving the cause instead of suppressing the symptoms - and I believe that the cause in me is overthinking, so that's what I'm focusing on.
